# STATUS — jesusfilm-rag

Live "you are here" for the build. Stable design lives in
[architecture.md](./architecture.md); per-source progress in
[sources.md](./sources.md). **This file is the churn layer** — update it
whenever state changes; keep it to ~one screen.

_Last updated: 2026-07-24 — **slice #8 (EveryStudent en) DONE, all 4 stages
green** on `slice/everystudent` (not yet merged); eval now **106 cases**; slice
#7 MERGED (PR #80) + prod cutover COMPLETE; prod is 100% qwen3 at **11,477 docs**_

## You are here

**Slice #8 (EveryStudent English, `everystudent`) is DONE — all 4 stages green,
Evaluated** on `slice/everystudent` (2026-07-24, **not yet merged**). The first
walled source, acquired through Firecrawl (ADR-0012, #114): **117 docs / 550
qwen3 chunks** at exactly 117 credits, queryable and evaluated in the 9-source
space. Scope was the English domain only — `everystudent-ar` /
`everystudent-fr` are separate keys, queued (ADR-0006, #112).

**Stage 4 was the first agent-driven `/golden` run (v4)** — the operator gated
the fork, the spend, and the write instead of typing the command. A 3-lens
judge panel (theologian / pastor / mature Christian) scored **230 (case, doc)
pairs over 160 whole documents**, both axes gated ≥ 0.75 in code: **85 credits
approved, 141 (61%) rejected as sound-but-off-question** (the tripwire, worse
than slice #7's 48%), 0 soundness failures, 0 escalations (max spread 0.20 —
the convergence caveat stands). qa-golden.yaml **96 → 106 cases** (+31
gap-fixes on 14 prior cases, +10 everystudent-native cases on the
seeker/apologetics axis).

**Final eval @ 106 cases / 9 sources:** recall@3 **0.953** · recall@10
**1.000** · coverage **0.703** · MRR 0.828 · P@1 0.698. **everystudent n=22:
recall 0.818 / coverage 0.739**, 9 of 10 native cases at rank 1. Every prior
en source moved UP — cru 0.861/0.636, thelife 0.878/0.634, sightline
0.783/0.563, **swg 0.458/0.375** (the feared displacement never materialized;
two slice-#1 gap docs credited as side-effects). **minScore 0.37 holds**; note
a resume-writing negative reached 0.505, the faith-adjacent band's closest
approach yet to the 0.55+ positive cluster.

⚠️ **Two recorded consequences to carry forward:** (1) the source's **9
null-language docs are excluded from all eval credits** (operator fork
decision — `caseLanguage()` has no unscoped pin, so crediting them would bake
unreturnable expectations into en-scoped cases); the loneliness case therefore
credits zero everystudent docs. They enter the keys only after a future
`lang:sweep` + re-review. (2) `pnpm test` remains 425/426 — the FOLLOW-UP J
#17/#75 canary, data-dependent (green in CI), **must be investigated before
the `ar`/`fr` slices**. See [docs/slices/everystudent.md](./slices/everystudent.md).

---

**Slice #7 (Cru consolidated, `cru`) is DONE and MERGED to `main`** (PR #80,
2026-07-14). One whole-domain source (en+es+fr) superseding `cru-10-basic-steps`
and the short-lived `cru-es` (one domain = one source, ADR-0006). **2,444 docs /
8,497 qwen3 chunks**, queryable in three languages.

**Prod cutover is COMPLETE.** `cru` was ingested + embedded in prod 2026-07-14
(dashboard PR #87: index 9,044 → 11,488). The cutover initially only ADDED — the 11
superseded `cru-10-basic-steps` docs stayed duplicated (#85) until their transactional
removal 2026-07-15 (PR #93: 11 docs / 35 chunks deleted, zero unique content lost,
`cru` intact at 2,444). The prod language sweep (LLM detector, ADR-0009, PRs
#92/#95/#96) then drained unclassified docs **190 → 0** and relabelled the phantom
`vi` doc → `es` (#84). **Prod now: 11,477 docs, 100% `qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b`.**
(Timeline: the re-embed + serving cutover was verified 2026-07-08 on the then-9,044-doc
**pre-cru** corpus — see sources.md "Embedding model swap"; the cru cutover 2026-07-14/15
and the language sweep grew prod to 11,477, with everything added since ingested directly
on qwen.) ⚠️ **Known gap: no `eval:production` has run since the cru
cutover** — cru's prod "Evaluated" rests on the local slice-#7 eval; the last prod
eval (2026-07-08, post-qwen) had zero English misses.

**Stage 4 (eval) used a 3-lens LLM judge panel** (theologian / pastor / mature
Christian) instead of a hand-curated pass. Every proposed credit was scored on
**TWO orthogonal axes** — *relevance* (does it answer THIS question) and *biblical
soundness* — both gated at 0.75. **73 of 151 proposals were biblically SOUND but
OFF-QUESTION**: orthodox docs answering a question nobody asked. A soundness-only
rubric would have auto-accepted every one into the answer keys and quietly
corrupted the eval. 73 credits approved; suite **82 → 96 cases** (+6 en cru-native,
**+8 es — the first Spanish cases in the suite**). Prompt preserved at
`docs/prompt-samples/2026-07-14-jfrag-golden-judge-panel.md` — **promoted into
`.claude/skills/golden` v3 as Guardrail #6** (two-axis relevance ⊥ soundness;
shipped with PR #80).

**Final eval @ 96 cases / 9 sources:** recall@3 **0.938** · recall@10 **1.000** ·
coverage **0.689** · MRR 0.814 · P@1 0.677. **cru per-source recall 0.125 → 0.828,
coverage 0.063 → 0.576 with NO engine change** — the 0.125 was a **stale answer
key** (still crediting only the 11 retired 10-Basic-Steps pages against a 2,444-doc
source), never a retrieval regression. **Per-language coverage — a new view:**
en 0.614 · **es 0.938** · fr 0.817 · zh 0.867, **0 unscoped**. minScore **0.37
holds in Spanish** (es negatives ≤ 0.308; es positive band 0.622–0.739).

**Two engine changes shipped this slice:**
- **`08acd48` — per-language coverage.** ADR-0006 made `cru` the first single source
  carrying several languages, so the per-source view BLENDS them and can hide an
  unhealthy language. `coverageByLanguage()` splits them; a case with no derivable
  language surfaces as `(unscoped)` rather than being dropped (that state is a bug).
- **`3418717` — candidate fan-out cap bug.** `candidateTopK` ceilinged at a flat 50,
  so any `topK >= 17` fetched 50 chunks → ~33 docs after dedup: `search` answered a
  request for 100 results with 33 and said nothing. Prod (topK 5) and eval (topK 10)
  sit under the old cap and were never affected — deep-k **curation probing** exposed
  it, which means every "not ranked" verdict really meant "not in the top ~33".

**Findings filed:** **[#78](https://github.com/JesusFilm/jesusfilm-rag/issues/78)** —
18 docs below 0.75 soundness (14 cru, **3 thelife ⚠️ already in prod**, 1 familylife).
One real pattern: **prosperity drift** (tithe → financial return) across four sources.
Deliberately **not** blanket-excluded from the crawl — none are heresy (0.57–0.73), 4
of the 14 are Spanish machine-translation damage misfiled as doctrine, and it was a
sample of 151 of ~11,500 docs, not an audit.

**Engine findings from slice #7 (detail in the slice file):**
- **FILED → [#79](https://github.com/JesusFilm/jesusfilm-rag/issues/79)** (architecture
  §11 FOLLOW-UP N): retrieval returns **one chunk per doc** and cru articles open with
  long lead-in anecdotes → **40 of 151 docs judged `answer_buried`** (right doc, useless
  snippet); compounded by **1,375 cru chunks (16.2%) beginning with the junk string
  `0 100 0`** (AEM artifact, no other source has it). **#79 CLOSED 2026-07-16** — opt-in
  `includeDocument` full-document-per-hit shipped (PR #97, ADR-0011); the extraction-side
  `0 100 0` junk-strip (needs a cru re-ingest) and lead-in detection remain open candidates.
- **Still unfiled:** Cru's Spanish corpus is **machine-translated to near-unreadability**
  — an acquire-side quality ceiling, not a soundness problem (do not file it as one).

See [docs/slices/cru.md](./slices/cru.md).

**Slice #1 (Starting With God) is DONE and MERGED to `main`** (PR #2,
2026-05-25) — acquired (40 rows), ingested (**40 docs / 183 chunks / 183
embeddings**, `openai/text-embedding-3-small`), retrievable, evaluated:
**recall@3 0.90 · recall@8 1.00 · MRR 0.82 · P@1 0.70** @ minScore **0.37**.

**Slice #2 (Cru "10 Basic Steps", `cru-10-basic-steps`) is DONE — all 4 stages green,
Evaluated, and MERGED to `main`** (PR #11, `b3105f7`). 11 docs / 35 chunks / 35
embeddings; retrievable + cited; two sources now coexist in one ranked space.

**Slice #3 (Jesus Film Project, `jesusfilm-org`) is DONE — all 4 stages green,
Evaluated** — on `slice/jesusfilm-org` (2026-05-26), **not yet merged**. It
triggered **FOLLOW-UP F**: Stage 1 built the **discovery-crawl** model
(`CrawlPolicy.sitemaps`+`allow`/`block`/`articleHints`; `src/acquisition/discover.ts`
recurses a sitemap index → filters → URL list; fakes-tested), because jesusfilm.org
is too large to hand-list. The live crawl staged **349/349 blog articles, 0 skips**
(417 sitemap locs → 349 kept; /give/ + .kml filtered), ingested to **349 docs /
2114 chunks / 2114 embeddings**, retrievable + cited. The corpus is now **3 sources**.
**Stage 4 (eval) via `/golden`:** 12 new persona-diverse jf cases + re-reviewed 11
existing cases' living `relevant` maps (qa-golden.yaml now **32 cases**). Curated
whole-corpus eval @ top-10: **recall@3 0.906 · recall@10 0.938 · coverage 0.803 ·
MRR 0.777 · P@1 0.656**; per-source **jf 0.913** / swg 0.833 / cru 0.714. **Key
lesson re-confirmed:** the pre-curation drop (stale 20 cases → recall@10 0.85) was a
**living-relevant-set artifact, not a retrieval regression** — re-reviewing the maps
made the 3 displaced misses (gospel/witnessing/prayer) pass. 2 honest misses remain
(`jf-skeptic-intolerant` out-ranked by uniqueness docs; `jf-believer-disciple-making`
a vocabulary gap). **minScore 0.37 held** (FOLLOW-UP A @ 3 sources). 86 tests green.
Two follow-ups filed this slice: **#14 (H)** ingest-time tag/keyword enrichment, **#15
(I)** consumer-specified retrieval diversity. EveryStudent `Blocked` / NextStep `Deferred`.

Eval methodology (source-agnostic questions + multi-source living `relevant` sets,
recall+coverage @ top-10) is stable — see **[docs/eval-approach.md](./eval-approach.md)**.

## Next action

**Operator decides:** (1) **merge `slice/everystudent` into `main`** (open a PR
from the branch); (2) **prod promotion** via the #115 bulk-copy path — never
`acquire:production` for this source; (3) next slice.

Queued next as slices, in order: **`everystudent-ar`** then **`everystudent-fr`**
(#112) — both gated on the **#17/#75 canary investigation**, which should be
tackled first (they are exactly the rare-language-drowning case it warns about).

Still open, operator decides when:

1. **Certify prod post-cutover** — run `pnpm eval:production` against the post-cutover
   corpus (11,477 docs). cru's prod "Evaluated" currently rests on the local slice-#7
   eval; the last recorded prod eval (2026-07-08) predates the cru cutover.
2. **Content soundness #78** — 18 docs below 0.75 soundness (14 cru, **3 thelife ⚠️
   already live in prod**, 1 familylife); prosperity-drift pattern. Remediation
   decisions pending.
3. **Retrieval-quality leads** — #76 (negation blindness) and #75 (HNSW drops best
   matches, worst for rare-language). #79 itself is closed (PR #97, ADR-0011); the cru
   `0 100 0` junk-strip (extraction-side, needs a cru re-ingest) is the remaining
   chunk-quality lead.
4. **FOLLOW-UP I #15** (`maxPerSource` / MMR) and **FOLLOW-UP E #6** (`excludedSourceKeys`)
   remain unblocked consumer-layer work.
5. **Next source slice** — GotQuestions / KnowGod / Issues I Face.

---

**Slice #6 (FamilyLife, `familylife`) is DONE 2026-06-04** on
`slice/familylife` (not yet merged). All 4 stages green; familylife
queryable end-to-end in the 6-source space (8,514 docs / 23,522 chunks).
**Final eval @ 6 sources / 62 cases / top-10:** recall@3 **0.984** ·
recall@10 **1.000** · coverage **0.648** · MRR **0.870** · P@1 **0.758**.
**Per-source: familylife n=16 recall=1.000 / coverage=0.958** (perfect
where credited) · thelife n=28 0.929/0.777 · jf n=28 0.750/0.604 ·
sightline n=37 0.784/0.582 · **swg n=21 0.524/0.367 — UP from 0.335**
(slice-#5 prior-source-up pattern re-confirmed at 6 sources) ·
**cru-10 n=15 0.133/0.067 — DOWN from 0.167** (sharpest FOLLOW-UP I #15
evidence yet: cru content/retrieval still work, but with 5 competing
sources cru pieces get displaced from top-10 on shared topics —
mechanism-not-policy, consumer-layer `maxPerSource`/MMR fix).
**Stage 4 via `/golden` v2 content-grounded:** **Part A** added 31 paths
across 8 cases — closed both regressions (`tl-believer-marriage-drift`
cov 0/5 hard-miss → rank 1 cov 9/14; `swg-believer-assurance` rank 4 → 3)
AND **19 prior-slice curation gaps** surfaced as side-effects (slice-#1
swg `/new-life/new.html`, slice-#3 jf `/blog/mental-health-and-the-church`,
slice-#4 sightline trio, slice-#5 thelife 8+ devotionals incl.
`/full-confidence`, `/how-to-know-im-really-saved`,
`/should-we-talk-about-it`, `/should-christians-go-to-therapy`,
`/the-new-deal`, `/the-prayer-of-anguish`, `/my-story-of-miscarriage`).
**Part B** added 10 persona-diverse familylife-native cases on the
marriage/parenting axis (4 seeker / 3 believer / 2 newcomer / 1 skeptic),
61 path credits + 6 *additional* prior-slice gaps surfaced (thelife
`/why-should-i-wait-for-sex` + 3 sightline sex-marriage devotionals;
thelife `/going-it-alone`, `/kids-divorce-and-remarriage`,
`/devotionals/our-greatest-burden`). qa-golden.yaml now **62 cases**.
**Only rank > 3 case:** `fl-skeptic-sex-marriage` at rank=4 — engine
ranks abstract intimacy pieces above direct "why wait" docs; honest
ranking quirk. **`minScore 0.37` holds at 6 sources** (3/3 negatives = 0
hits). **`/equip/` retention DECIDED — KEEP all 70 rows:** 4 paths
credited as legitimate relevant docs and surface in top-10; teaser half
didn't displace good content in 12 probes; Stage-1 bimodal prediction
validated, no re-ingest. 114/114 tests green, depcruise 76/0, 0 lint
errors. **Stage 4a+4b commit:** `e5d46c4`. **≥4 sources now done end-to-end
→ FOLLOW-UP E #6 (consumer source-exclude filter) fully unblocked** —
abundant fixtures across familylife/thelife/sightline/jf for testing
narrow-only exclusion.

**Next pick — operator decides:** (1) **Merge slice #6** to `main` (open
PR from `slice/familylife`); (2) **FOLLOW-UP I #15** (`maxPerSource` / MMR
consumer-layer) — evidence is now devastating, cru drops 0.321→0.167→0.067
across slices #4/#5/#6 with monotonic sharpening; this is engine work, not
`/slice`; (3) **FOLLOW-UP E #6** (`excludedSourceKeys`) — now fully
unblocked; consumer-layer too; (4) **GotQuestions / KnowGod / Issues I Face**
as next backlog source slice (GotQuestions would amplify #15 further;
Issues I Face needs different discovery — sitemap 404); (5) **Cru
accordion-TOC strip** (citation quality follow-up from slice #2).

**Slice #5 (`thelife`) is DONE and MERGED to `main`** ([PR #31](https://github.com/JesusFilm/jesusfilm-rag/pull/31),
`dc8cfaf`, 2026-06-03). 4,485 docs / 7,905 chunks / 7,905 embeddings; thelife
corpus fully queryable + evaluated. **Final eval @ 52 cases / 5 sources:**
recall@3/@10 **1.000** · coverage **0.624** · MRR **0.907** · P@1 **0.827**.
Per-source highlights: thelife 0.955/0.851 (perfect where credited),
cru 0.200/0.167 (unchanged — sharper FOLLOW-UP I #15 evidence, not a
regression). The slice-#4 sightline curation gap (15+ docs) and the
slice-#3 `jf-believer-disciple-making` vocab gap were both closed as
side-effects of the content-grounded `/golden` re-review.

**Slice #6 historical record (Stages 1+2 DONE 2026-06-03)** on
`slice/familylife`. WordPress VIP via `sitemaps.xml`; reused slice #3/#4/#5
discovery crawler with no new acquisition code (FOLLOW-UP F durable across 4
sources now: jf/sightline/thelife/familylife). **Acquired 2,239 / 2,329
(96.1%)** across 2 passes — pass 1 SIGINT-stopped at 1,431 for laptop
disconnect, pass 2 walked the full list (surfaced **FOLLOW-UP K #32**:
fetch-layer idempotency gap — re-runs of paused crawls re-fetch already-staged
URLs because conditional headers aren't threaded). All status 200, zero 429s
across 4,569 fetches. 88 too-thin skips concentrated on `/equip/` (84 —
bimodal: real teaching + PDF/course teaser hubs); /equip/ retention deferred
to Stage 4. **Ingested all 2,239 raw → 2,239 docs / 9,815 chunks / 9,815
embeds** (`openai/text-embedding-3-small`, 1536d); perfect 1:1, 0 mismatches,
chunks/doc avg 4.38. Corpus now **6 sources / 8,514 docs / 23,522 chunks**
(+60% chunk growth vs slice-5 end). **Verify gate green at new size** but
the data growth fired the pre-existing canary in
`tests/retrieval.integration.test.ts` — **FOLLOW-UP J #17** (HNSW post-filter
under-recalls in-scope docs when out-of-scope neighbors dominate the graph)
now actively bites at 23.5k chunks (was dormant at ~14k). Test loosened as
a stop-gap; full empirical evidence (max real cosine vs `oneHot(0)` = 0.12;
HNSW graph topology, not cosine cutoff) appended to #17.

**Stage 3 (Retrieve) DONE 2026-06-04** — spot-retrieval against the 6-source
space via `pnpm query`, no code changes. Family-axis queries: familylife
dominates (10/10 on spiritual leadership + teen discipling; 8-9/10 on character
+ affair recovery) while adjacent sources still surface where they should
(thelife at ranks 2+9 on character question). **Cross-source health PRESERVED
at 6 sources:** sightline #1 + jf #2 unchanged on "Christianity intolerant?"
(slice #3→#4 closure intact); **swg flagship "How to Be Sure of Heaven" still
ranks #2 at exactly 0.548 — the 0.003 edge from slice 5 held; slice-1's
founding source was NOT buried by +9,815 familylife chunks.** Familylife
meaningfully enters the anxiety domain (was thelife monopoly in slice 5;
includes one /equip/ row that's real teaching, validating the Stage-1
bimodal-/equip/ prediction). Negatives confirm **minScore 0.37 holds at 6
sources** (secular 0 hits; faith-adjacent Quran/fasting 0.388-0.441 below the
0.55+ positive band).

See **[docs/slices/familylife.md](./slices/familylife.md)** for the slice-6
record, and **[docs/slices/thelife.md](./slices/thelife.md)** for slice 5.
The "Next pick" candidates above subsume the prior "Still on the table"
list — FOLLOW-UP E is now fully unblocked (≥4 done sources), FOLLOW-UP I
is at devastating-evidence sharpness, and FamilyLife's marriage/parenting
axis closes the corpus gap that started slice #6.

## How we're building (decided 2026-05-22)

- **Vertical slices, one source at a time.** Drive ONE source fully through
  acquire → ingest → retrieve → spot-check, then move to the next. This refines
  architecture §9's horizontal order — module boundaries and ports are
  unchanged, only the build order.
- **jfa is a behavioral reference, not a port target.** We learn what worked;
  we do not transplant its files.
- **Defer the "generic crawler vs. per-source scraper" decision** until 2–3
  sources reveal the real pattern.
- **Eval** (spot-checks first, then recall@k / MRR) gets built once slice #1 has
  real data to evaluate against.
- **`/slice` drives the work.** A lightweight, resumable slice-driver
  (`.claude/skills/slice/`): reads this file, unpacks the next slice (or resumes
  an in-progress one), runs the verify gate, and checkpoints each step to a slice
  file + commit. Pauses at stage boundaries and real decisions, in plain language.

## The slice loop (repeat per source)

1. **Acquire** — fetch + extract its pages → `raw_documents`.
2. **Ingest** — drain `raw_documents` → normalize → chunk → embed → corpus tables.
3. **Retrieve** — embedQuery → vectorSearch → ranked, cited results.
4. **Spot-check** — run real queries, eyeball quality; note findings in `sources.md`.

("Challenge" greps were false positives from cloudflare-hosted asset URLs — the
high word counts confirm real content, not an anti-bot page.)

## Open decisions / blockers

- ~~`.env` missing `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN`~~ — resolved by **removing** the unused
  serving/auth vars (`MCP_PORT`, `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN`, `MCP_BEARER_SCOPES`,
  `CLIENT_HASH_SECRET`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`) from `src/env.ts`. No code reads them
  yet; the env schema now declares only what's consumed (`DATABASE_URL`,
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `EMBED_MODEL_ID`). **Update — step 6 landed (PR #19):**
  serving added `PORT` + `SERVE_BEARER_TOKENS` (HTTP `/v1`, not the old `MCP_*`
  set); `CLIENT_HASH_SECRET` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` stay dropped.
- ~~Embedding model diverged from decision 1~~ — resolved: re-embedded on
  `openai/text-embedding-3-small` (both it and the nvidia free model are reachable
  via OpenRouter at 1536 dims; openai is the locked choice).
- ~~OpenRouter API key must be in `.env` before ingest~~ — present; Stage 2 ran.
- ~~First source = Starting With God~~ — confirmed; acquired + ingested.

## Process TODOs (deferred)

- **Seed-URL discovery → now informed by jfa.** We examined jfa's source registry
  (2026-05-25); the full findings are in
  **[docs/jfa-registry-findings.md](./jfa-registry-findings.md)** — read it before
  picking the next source or deciding how to crawl one. Two recurring forks are now
  written up as **architecture §11 FOLLOW-UP F** (adopt jfa's discovery-crawl policy
  shape — `seeds`+`allow`/`block`/`articleHints`+`contentSelectors`+`sitemaps`;
  trigger = first large source) and **FOLLOW-UP G** (Cloudflare/JS-walled sources —
  EveryStudent confirmed walled; bypass options listed). For small curated scopes
  (like the since-retired `cru-10-basic-steps`, 12 ready-made URLs — absorbed into
  whole-domain `cru` in slice #7) the hand-listed `seedPaths` code is still fine;
  neither follow-up was taken in slice #2.

## Done

- **Step 1** — bare-out + §6 schema + §5 enforcement gates (depcruise / max-lines / fakes-only).
- **Step 2** — Postgres storage adapters (CorpusWrite, CorpusSearch, FetchState) + in-memory fakes; integration-tested against docker Postgres.
- **2026-05-22** — lightweight tracking (this file) + vertical-slice build decision; reachability recon of all 6 sources.
- **Slice #1, Stage 1 (Acquire)** — RawDocumentStore port/fake/adapter, SourceRegistry + Starting With God entry, Acquisition context (normalizeUrl/extraction/acquireOne/acquireSource), HTTP Fetcher adapter, `pnpm acquire`. Live crawl staged **40/40 clean rows** in `raw_documents`. On `slice/starting-with-god`.
- **Slice #1, Stage 2 (Ingest)** — OpenRouter Embedder adapter, Ingestion context (normalize → jfa-ported chunk → embed → dedup → idempotent replaceDocument), RawDocumentReader read port/fake/adapter, `pnpm index`. Live run drained `raw_documents` → **40 docs / 183 chunks / 183 embeddings** (`openai/text-embedding-3-small`); idempotent re-run drains 0. 47 tests green. `pnpm index --force` = full re-index from the raw snapshot (used to re-embed off an accidental `.env` model override). On `slice/starting-with-god`.
- **Slice #1, Stage 3 (Retrieve)** — Retrieval context (`src/retrieval/`): `createRetriever` runs invariant 5 (embedQuery → vectorSearch candidate fan-out → minScore 0.3 cutoff → soft preferSourceKey tiebreak → 3-key dedup → citation). Wired into `main.wire()`; `pnpm query "<q>"` entry point; `scripts/eval.ts` step-5 TODO closed (drives the real Retriever). 12 fakes-only tests (59 total). Live query returns 5 distinct cited docs. **Decision:** 3-key dedup ⇒ at most one chunk per document (content-hash is doc-level). On `slice/starting-with-god`.
- **Slice #2 (Cru "10 Basic Steps", `cru-10-basic-steps`)** — full acquire → ingest → retrieve → eval on `slice/cru-10-basic-steps` (not yet merged). 11 docs / 35 chunks / 35 embeddings (AEM `.article-long-form` extraction). **Stage 4 built the per-source eval mechanism:** required `source` tag on golden cases, `pnpm eval --source <key>`, and a per-source breakdown (pure logic in `scripts/eval-metrics.ts`, unit-tested from `tests/`; +15 tests, 80 total). 10 persona-diverse cru golden cases authored. Whole-corpus eval (20 cases / 2 sources): recall@3 0.80 / recall@8 0.90 / MRR 0.62 / P@1 0.45; minScore **0.37 (FOLLOW-UP A re-confirmed, held)**. **Stage 4 also reframed the eval** (`8fbee09`) to source-agnostic questions + multi-source `relevant` maps scored on recall + coverage — v2 whole-corpus recall@10 1.00 / coverage 0.896 / P@1 0.80, per-source coverage cru 0.929 / swg 0.906 (resolved the v1 cru P@1 0.20 artifact). Remaining: accordion-TOC chunk hurts cru citation quality (extraction-side follow-up). See `docs/eval-approach.md`; Cru → Evaluated in `sources.md`.
- **Serving (step 6) — DONE** (`feat/serving-v1`, PR #19; closes #9 + #12). Versioned `/v1` HTTP adapter (`src/serving/http/`, Hono) over the injected `Retriever`: `POST /v1/search` + `GET /v1/health`, bearer auth + `allowedSourceKeys` scope intersection (narrow-only). Single-source **Zod** contract (`src/contracts/retrieval.schema.ts`) → generated `contracts/openapi.v1.json` (`pnpm gen:contract`) + drift test; versioning policy in architecture §3.1. Runs in `docker compose` alongside Postgres (`:8080`, no manual env); `pnpm smoke` is the consumer/CD probe. 108 tests green. **MCP adapter deferred** (a later variant over the same `Retriever`).
- **Slice #5 (thelife, `thelife`)** — pivoted from `power-to-change` (decommissioned) on 2026-05-29 to thelife.com (Cru Canada's live successor). Statamic source, **first time the discovery crawler ran against a non-WordPress site**; two-pass crawl (Cloudflare forced 1000→2000 ms delay) staged **4,485 of 4,552 distinct rows (98.5%)**. Ingest drained all 4,485 → **4,485 docs / 7,905 chunks / 7,905 embeddings** (chunks/doc avg 1.76 — devotional-dominant; corpus now 5 sources / ~6.5 k docs / ~14.7 k chunks). Stage 3 spot-retrieval: thelife dominates devotional/life-issues; cross-source health preserved; minScore 0.37 holds. **Stage 4 ran `/golden` in content-grounded mode for the first time** — operator pushed back on title-only review; we rebuilt curation around a surgical probe returning chunk snippets per candidate. Part A added 67 paths across 12 regressed cases (incidentally closing a slice-#4 sightline curation gap AND the slice-#3 `jf-believer-disciple-making` vocab gap); Part B added 10 new persona-diverse thelife-native cases (52 total now). **Final eval @ 52 cases / 5 sources:** recall@3/@10 1.000 · coverage 0.624 · MRR 0.907 · P@1 0.827. cru/swg per-source coverage unchanged from pre-curation (0.17/0.34) — confirms slice-#4 mechanism: thelife/sightline crowd small sources out of top-10 even when both legitimately answer. **Sharpest FOLLOW-UP I #15 evidence yet.** On `slice/thelife` (not yet merged).
