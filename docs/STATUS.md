Live "you are here" for the build. Stable design lives in
[architecture.md](./architecture.md); per-source progress in
[sources.md](./sources.md). **This file is the churn layer** — update it
whenever state changes; keep it to ~one screen.

## You are here

**Slice #1 (Starting With God) is DONE and MERGED to `main`** (PR #2,
2026-05-25) — acquired (40 rows), ingested (**40 docs / 183 chunks / 183
embeddings**, `openai/text-embedding-3-small`), retrievable, evaluated:
**recall@3 0.90 · recall@8 1.00 · MRR 0.82 · P@1 0.70** @ minScore **0.37**.

**Slice #2 (Cru "10 Basic Steps", `cru-10-basic-steps`) is DONE — all 4 stages green,
Evaluated** — on `slice/cru-10-basic-steps`, **not yet merged**. 11 docs / 35 chunks / 35
embeddings; retrievable + cited; two sources now coexist in one ranked space.
**Stage 4 added a per-source eval mechanism** (`source` tag on every golden case +
`pnpm eval --source <key>` + a per-source breakdown; scoped run == breakdown row).
Authored 10 persona-diverse cru golden cases. **Whole-corpus eval (20 cases / 2 sources):
recall@3 0.80 / recall@8 0.90 / MRR 0.62 / P@1 0.45**; cru-10 breakdown **0.70 / 0.90 /
0.44 / 0.20** @ minScore **0.37** (FOLLOW-UP A re-confirmed — held; noise floor didn't rise,
both misses are ranking displacement not cutoff). Honest finding: **SwG out-ranks cru on
shared topics** (its Q&A-shaped articles out-embed cru's curriculum/workbook format → cru
P@1 0.20). Citation-quality limitation: the leading **accordion-TOC chunk** is sometimes the
top-cited cru snippet (extraction-side; candidate follow-up). 80 tests green. Parked
candidates carried forward on the branch: **EveryStudent** `Blocked` (Cloudflare) +
**NextStep** `Deferred` (marketing site).

## Next action

**Slice #2 is complete (Evaluated).** Two operator decisions, then pick the next slice:

1. **Merge** `slice/cru-10-basic-steps` → `main` (carries the per-source eval mechanism +
   the EveryStudent `Blocked` / NextStep `Deferred` records forward). Not done automatically.
2. **Start slice #3.** Remaining short-list `Not started`: **Jesus Film Project**
   (jesusfilm.org — owned, large) and **Sightline Ministry** (content-heavy). Read
   `docs/jfa-registry-findings.md` before picking/crawling (FOLLOW-UP F/G live there for a
   large or walled source).

**Now unblocked (2 sources end-to-end): FOLLOW-UP E — consumer `excludedSourceKeys`
filter** ([#6](https://github.com/JesusFilm/jesusfilm-rag/issues/6)). Can be a small
standalone change or folded into slice #3; NextStep football2026 was earmarked as its
seasonal-exclusion fixture. **New candidate follow-up:** strip the AEM accordion-section TOC
during Cru acquisition (top-cited cru chunk is sometimes the section list, not prose —
citation quality, not recall).

→ **`/slice <source>`** starts the next slice; `/slice` alone resumes an in-progress one
(none right now). Merge is the operator's call.

## How we're building (decided 2026-05-22)

- **Vertical slices, one source at a time.** Drive ONE source fully through
  acquire → ingest → retrieve → spot-check, then move to the next. This refines
  architecture §9's horizontal order — module boundaries and ports are
  unchanged, only the build order.
- **jfa is a behavioral reference, not a port target.** We learn what worked;
  we do not transplant its files.
- **Defer the "generic crawler vs. per-source scraper" decision** until 2–3
  sources reveal the real pattern.
- **Eval** (spot-checks first, then recall@k / MRR) gets built once slice #1 has
  real data to evaluate against.
- **`/slice` drives the work.** A lightweight, resumable slice-driver
  (`.claude/skills/slice/`): reads this file, unpacks the next slice (or resumes
  an in-progress one), runs the verify gate, and checkpoints each step to a slice
  file + commit. Pauses at stage boundaries and real decisions, in plain language.

## The slice loop (repeat per source)

1. **Acquire** — fetch + extract its pages → `raw_documents`.
2. **Ingest** — drain `raw_documents` → normalize → chunk → embed → corpus tables.
3. **Retrieve** — embedQuery → vectorSearch → ranked, cited results.
4. **Spot-check** — run real queries, eyeball quality; note findings in `sources.md`.

high word counts confirm real content, not an anti-bot page.)

## Open decisions / blockers

- ~~`.env` missing `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN`~~ — resolved by **removing** the unused
  serving/auth vars (`MCP_PORT`, `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN`, `MCP_BEARER_SCOPES`,
  `CLIENT_HASH_SECRET`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`) from `src/env.ts`. No code reads them
  yet; the env schema now declares only what's consumed (`DATABASE_URL`,
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `EMBED_MODEL_ID`). They return in step 6 with the MCP
  serving adapter that actually reads them.
- ~~Embedding model diverged from decision 1~~ — resolved: re-embedded on
  `openai/text-embedding-3-small` (both it and the nvidia free model are reachable
  via OpenRouter at 1536 dims; openai is the locked choice).
- ~~OpenRouter API key must be in `.env` before ingest~~ — present; Stage 2 ran.
- ~~First source = Starting With God~~ — confirmed; acquired + ingested.

## Process TODOs (deferred)

- **Seed-URL discovery → now informed by jfa.** We examined jfa's source registry
  (2026-05-25); the full findings are in
  **[docs/jfa-registry-findings.md](./jfa-registry-findings.md)** — read it before
  picking the next source or deciding how to crawl one. Two recurring forks are now
  written up as **architecture §11 FOLLOW-UP F** (adopt jfa's discovery-crawl policy
  shape — `seeds`+`allow`/`block`/`articleHints`+`contentSelectors`+`sitemaps`;
  trigger = first large source) and **FOLLOW-UP G** (Cloudflare/JS-walled sources —
  EveryStudent confirmed walled; bypass options listed). For small curated scopes
  (like `cru-10-basic-steps`, 12 ready-made URLs) the current hand-listed `seedPaths`
  code is still fine; neither follow-up is taken in slice #2.

## Done

- **Step 1** — bare-out + §6 schema + §5 enforcement gates (depcruise / max-lines / fakes-only).
- **Step 2** — Postgres storage adapters (CorpusWrite, CorpusSearch, FetchState) + in-memory fakes; integration-tested against docker Postgres.
- **2026-05-22** — lightweight tracking (this file) + vertical-slice build decision; reachability recon of all 6 sources.
- **Slice #1, Stage 1 (Acquire)** — RawDocumentStore port/fake/adapter, SourceRegistry + Starting With God entry, Acquisition context (normalizeUrl/extraction/acquireOne/acquireSource), HTTP Fetcher adapter, `pnpm acquire`. Live crawl staged **40/40 clean rows** in `raw_documents`. On `slice/starting-with-god`.
- **Slice #1, Stage 2 (Ingest)** — OpenRouter Embedder adapter, Ingestion context (normalize → jfa-ported chunk → embed → dedup → idempotent replaceDocument), RawDocumentReader read port/fake/adapter, `pnpm index`. Live run drained `raw_documents` → **40 docs / 183 chunks / 183 embeddings** (`openai/text-embedding-3-small`); idempotent re-run drains 0. 47 tests green. `pnpm index --force` = full re-index from the raw snapshot (used to re-embed off an accidental `.env` model override). On `slice/starting-with-god`.
- **Slice #1, Stage 3 (Retrieve)** — Retrieval context (`src/retrieval/`): `createRetriever` runs invariant 5 (embedQuery → vectorSearch candidate fan-out → minScore 0.3 cutoff → soft preferSourceKey tiebreak → 3-key dedup → citation). Wired into `main.wire()`; `pnpm query "<q>"` entry point; `scripts/eval.ts` step-5 TODO closed (drives the real Retriever). 12 fakes-only tests (59 total). Live query returns 5 distinct cited docs. **Decision:** 3-key dedup ⇒ at most one chunk per document (content-hash is doc-level). On `slice/starting-with-god`.
- **Slice #2 (Cru "10 Basic Steps", `cru-10-basic-steps`)** — full acquire → ingest → retrieve → eval on `slice/cru-10-basic-steps` (not yet merged). 11 docs / 35 chunks / 35 embeddings (AEM `.article-long-form` extraction). **Stage 4 built the per-source eval mechanism:** required `source` tag on golden cases, `pnpm eval --source <key>`, and a per-source breakdown (pure logic in `scripts/eval-metrics.ts`, unit-tested from `tests/`; +15 tests, 80 total). 10 persona-diverse cru golden cases authored. Whole-corpus eval (20 cases / 2 sources): recall@3 0.80 / recall@8 0.90 / MRR 0.62 / P@1 0.45; cru-10 breakdown 0.70/0.90/0.44/0.20 @ minScore **0.37 (FOLLOW-UP A re-confirmed, held)**. Findings: SwG out-ranks cru on shared topics (Q&A vs curriculum format); accordion-TOC chunk hurts cru citation quality (extraction-side follow-up). Cru → Evaluated in `sources.md`.
