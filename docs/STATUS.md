# STATUS — jesusfilm-rag

Live "you are here" for the build. Stable design lives in
[architecture.md](./architecture.md); per-source progress in
[sources.md](./sources.md). **This file is the churn layer** — update it
whenever state changes; keep it to ~one screen.

## You are here

**Slice #1 (Starting With God) is DONE and MERGED to `main`** (PR #2,
2026-05-25) — acquired (40 rows), ingested (**40 docs / 183 chunks / 183
embeddings**, `openai/text-embedding-3-small`), retrievable, evaluated:
**recall@3 0.90 · recall@8 1.00 · MRR 0.82 · P@1 0.70** @ minScore **0.37**.

**Slice #2 is Cru "10 Basic Steps"** (`cru-10-basic-steps`), IN PROGRESS on
`slice/cru-10-basic-steps`. **Stages 1–3 (Acquire + Ingest + Retrieve) are complete.**
Acquire staged **11/12 clean lesson rows** in `raw_documents` (the index page correctly
skipped too-thin), AEM `.article-long-form` selector verified. Ingest drained all 11 →
**11 docs / 35 chunks / 35 embeddings** (`openai/text-embedding-3-small`, 1536 dims,
consistent with starting-with-god); 0 chunk_count mismatches, idempotent re-run drains 0.
Retrieve: live queries return cited, on-topic cru-10 hits in both whole-corpus and
source-scoped modes (wins rank 1 on Witnessing / Abundant Life / Obedience) — two sources
now coexist in one ranked space. One quality wrinkle carried to Stage 4: the leading
accordion-TOC chunk sometimes surfaces instead of lesson prose. 65 tests green. Chosen after examining jfa's registry (12 ready-made URLs, on-mission,
fits the current `seedPaths` code). Two earlier candidates parked: **EveryStudent**
`Blocked` (Cloudflare JS challenge, jfa-confirmed) and **NextStep** `Deferred` (8-page
marketing site). The branch carries both records forward.

## Next action

**Drive slice #2 Stage 4 (Eval + spot-check).** The unpacked sub-step checklist, decisions,
and resume hint live in **[docs/slices/cru-10-basic-steps.md](./slices/cru-10-basic-steps.md)**.
This is the **first stage that needs new code:** (1) per-source eval mechanism — a `source`
tag on the golden schema + `pnpm eval --source <key>` + a per-source breakdown; (2) author
persona-diverse cru-10 golden cases via `/golden`; (3) run the **whole-corpus** `pnpm eval`
(now 2 sources) → re-derive `minScore` (FOLLOW-UP A: expect drift toward, not below, 0.35);
(4) spot-check positives + off-topic negatives → `sources.md` (→ Evaluated). Watch the
accordion-TOC chunk wrinkle. **FOLLOW-UP E (`excludedSourceKeys`) unblocks at slice close**
(2nd source now end-to-end).

Two pieces unblock now that a 2nd source is landing — both fold into slice #2's
Stage 4: the **per-source eval** mechanism (`source` tag per golden case + `pnpm
eval --source <key>` + per-source breakdown), and **FOLLOW-UP E** (consumer
`excludedSourceKeys` filter — surfaced at slice close per the architecture trigger).

→ **Resume with `/slice`** — it reads this file + the slice file, checks out the
branch, and continues at the first unchecked sub-step.

## How we're building (decided 2026-05-22)

- **Vertical slices, one source at a time.** Drive ONE source fully through
  acquire → ingest → retrieve → spot-check, then move to the next. This refines
  architecture §9's horizontal order — module boundaries and ports are
  unchanged, only the build order.
- **jfa is a behavioral reference, not a port target.** We learn what worked;
  we do not transplant its files.
- **Defer the "generic crawler vs. per-source scraper" decision** until 2–3
  sources reveal the real pattern.
- **Eval** (spot-checks first, then recall@k / MRR) gets built once slice #1 has
  real data to evaluate against.
- **`/slice` drives the work.** A lightweight, resumable slice-driver
  (`.claude/skills/slice/`): reads this file, unpacks the next slice (or resumes
  an in-progress one), runs the verify gate, and checkpoints each step to a slice
  file + commit. Pauses at stage boundaries and real decisions, in plain language.

## The slice loop (repeat per source)

1. **Acquire** — fetch + extract its pages → `raw_documents`.
2. **Ingest** — drain `raw_documents` → normalize → chunk → embed → corpus tables.
3. **Retrieve** — embedQuery → vectorSearch → ranked, cited results.
4. **Spot-check** — run real queries, eyeball quality; note findings in `sources.md`.

high word counts confirm real content, not an anti-bot page.)

## Open decisions / blockers

- ~~`.env` missing `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN`~~ — resolved by **removing** the unused
  serving/auth vars (`MCP_PORT`, `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN`, `MCP_BEARER_SCOPES`,
  `CLIENT_HASH_SECRET`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`) from `src/env.ts`. No code reads them
  yet; the env schema now declares only what's consumed (`DATABASE_URL`,
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `EMBED_MODEL_ID`). They return in step 6 with the MCP
  serving adapter that actually reads them.
- ~~Embedding model diverged from decision 1~~ — resolved: re-embedded on
  `openai/text-embedding-3-small` (both it and the nvidia free model are reachable
  via OpenRouter at 1536 dims; openai is the locked choice).
- ~~OpenRouter API key must be in `.env` before ingest~~ — present; Stage 2 ran.
- ~~First source = Starting With God~~ — confirmed; acquired + ingested.

## Process TODOs (deferred)

- **Seed-URL discovery → now informed by jfa.** We examined jfa's source registry
  (2026-05-25); the full findings are in
  **[docs/jfa-registry-findings.md](./jfa-registry-findings.md)** — read it before
  picking the next source or deciding how to crawl one. Two recurring forks are now
  written up as **architecture §11 FOLLOW-UP F** (adopt jfa's discovery-crawl policy
  shape — `seeds`+`allow`/`block`/`articleHints`+`contentSelectors`+`sitemaps`;
  trigger = first large source) and **FOLLOW-UP G** (Cloudflare/JS-walled sources —
  EveryStudent confirmed walled; bypass options listed). For small curated scopes
  (like `cru-10-basic-steps`, 12 ready-made URLs) the current hand-listed `seedPaths`
  code is still fine; neither follow-up is taken in slice #2.

## Done

- **Step 1** — bare-out + §6 schema + §5 enforcement gates (depcruise / max-lines / fakes-only).
- **Step 2** — Postgres storage adapters (CorpusWrite, CorpusSearch, FetchState) + in-memory fakes; integration-tested against docker Postgres.
- **2026-05-22** — lightweight tracking (this file) + vertical-slice build decision; reachability recon of all 6 sources.
- **Slice #1, Stage 1 (Acquire)** — RawDocumentStore port/fake/adapter, SourceRegistry + Starting With God entry, Acquisition context (normalizeUrl/extraction/acquireOne/acquireSource), HTTP Fetcher adapter, `pnpm acquire`. Live crawl staged **40/40 clean rows** in `raw_documents`. On `slice/starting-with-god`.
- **Slice #1, Stage 2 (Ingest)** — OpenRouter Embedder adapter, Ingestion context (normalize → jfa-ported chunk → embed → dedup → idempotent replaceDocument), RawDocumentReader read port/fake/adapter, `pnpm index`. Live run drained `raw_documents` → **40 docs / 183 chunks / 183 embeddings** (`openai/text-embedding-3-small`); idempotent re-run drains 0. 47 tests green. `pnpm index --force` = full re-index from the raw snapshot (used to re-embed off an accidental `.env` model override). On `slice/starting-with-god`.
- **Slice #1, Stage 3 (Retrieve)** — Retrieval context (`src/retrieval/`): `createRetriever` runs invariant 5 (embedQuery → vectorSearch candidate fan-out → minScore 0.3 cutoff → soft preferSourceKey tiebreak → 3-key dedup → citation). Wired into `main.wire()`; `pnpm query "<q>"` entry point; `scripts/eval.ts` step-5 TODO closed (drives the real Retriever). 12 fakes-only tests (59 total). Live query returns 5 distinct cited docs. **Decision:** 3-key dedup ⇒ at most one chunk per document (content-hash is doc-level). On `slice/starting-with-god`.
