# Findings: jesusfilm-ai's source registry (how sources were really gathered)

_Captured 2026-05-25, during slice #2. **Read this before picking the next source
or deciding how to crawl one.** We hit two recurring forks — *discovery-crawl vs
hand-listed seeds*, and *Cloudflare-walled sources* — and this is the institutional
memory so we don't re-derive it each slice._

> **Stance unchanged:** jfa is a **behavioral reference, not a port target**
> (STATUS, 2026-05-22). We learn what worked and reuse the *curation* (the
> expensive human part — which URLs, which selectors, which sources block bots).
> We do **not** transplant jfa's files. Adopting its crawl-policy *shape* is a
> real architecture decision, teed up below — not yet taken.

## Where the intel lives (jfa)

```
apps/api/src/sources/registry.ts                 ~20 source entries (the gold)
apps/api/src/sources/sync.ts                      registry → source_inventory DB rows
apps/api/src/sources/{everystudent,startingwithgod}-language-sites.json   multilingual sibling domains
apps/api/scripts/registry-check.js                no-network CI smoke test of allow/block policies
apps/api/src/ingest/{policy,robots,http-cache,scheduler}.ts   the ingestion foundation (we deferred robots + http-cache)
```

## Model 1 — discovery-crawl policy, not a hand-listed article set

Our slice #1 (Starting With God) hardcoded **40 exact article paths** in
`seedPaths`. jfa instead declares a *policy* per source and lets a crawler
**discover** the article set:

| Field | Role |
|---|---|
| `seeds[]` | entry points — **frequently the `sitemap.xml` itself** + a few index/category pages, not every article |
| `allow[]` | regexes; a URL must match ≥1 to be kept (usually the host/scope) |
| `block[]` | regexes to drop: `login\|donate\|cart\|account\|wp-admin\|feed\|*.pdf/jpg/... \|?utm_` |
| `articleHints[]` | regexes for "this is a content article, not nav/index" |
| `contentSelectors[]` | ordered CSS selectors for the main container (first match wins) |
| `sitemaps[]` | explicit sitemap list (used by Sightline) |
| `maxPages`, `requestDelayMs`, `minContentLength`, `maxChunksPerDocument` | crawl limits |

So you curate **rules + a sitemap seed**, and discovery fills in the pages — the
only way the big corpora (GotQuestions ~1500, Sightline ~2500, FamilyLife ~15000)
are tractable. Our current code does **not** discover; it fetches exactly the
`seedPaths` listed. That's fine for small static sources, a dead end for large ones.

## Model 2 — one domain → many scoped source *keys*

A domain is **not** one source. cru.org is ~10 entries, each with a `scopePath`:

```
cru-about, cru-org (=/train-and-grow/), cru-10-basic-steps, cru-beginning-with-god,
cru-transferable-concepts, cru-classics, cru-pathways,
cru-oneness-in-diversity, cru-oneness-ethnic-cultural, cru-oneness-generational,
cru-compassionate-and-faithful
```

`getSourceForUrl(url)` routes a URL to the entry whose `scopePath` is the **longest
matching path prefix** (entries with no scope match the whole domain at length 0).
Each scope gets its own `defaultTags` / `defaultCategory` / `rights`. This is why
"do Cru" really means "do a chosen Cru *scope*" — and why slice #2 can be just
`cru-10-basic-steps` (12 curated URLs) without crawling all of cru.org.

## Trust + ingestion mode are first-class

- `trust`: `owned | partner | trusted | evaluating | blocked`
- `ingestionMode`: `html-scrape | api | manual | rss | blocked`
- `crawlableSources()` = `html-scrape` **and** has a `crawl` block. `blocked`/`manual`/`api`
  entries are registered for **rights/notes/routing** but never crawled.

## Per-source intel (reuse this curation)

| Key | Trust | Mode | Scale | On-mission? | Notes / hazards |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gotquestions-org` | trusted | html-scrape | ~1500 | **yes — strongest seeker-Q&A** | flat `content_<Topic>.html` index seeds; articleHints exclude indexes/top20 |
| `jesusfilm-org` | owned | html-scrape | ~1200 | yes | resources/stories/blog/learn; `sitemap_index.xml` seed |
| `sightline-ministry` | partner | html-scrape | ~2500 | yes — apologetics | explicit `sitemaps[]`; rich `.o-longform-content__content` selectors; skeptic/evidence |
| `cru-org` (+ scopes) | partner | html-scrape | bounded each | yes — discipleship/org | **`cru-10-basic-steps` = 12 ready-made URLs** (← slice #2). cru.org content-reachable (probed 200) |
| `familylife-com` | partner | html-scrape | ~15000 | yes — marriage/parenting | WordPress VIP; `sitemaps.xml` |
| `powertochange-com` | partner | html-scrape | ~1200 | yes — discipleship/life-issues | sitemap-driven |
| `knowgod-com` | partner | html-scrape | ~200 | yes — gospel tracts | **Angular shell** (JS-rendered) — may need browser rendering |
| `arclight-videos` | owned | **api** | — | media metadata | v2 API, not HTML; routes via jesusfilm-org |
| `joshua-project` | trusted | **manual** | — | missions data | CSV import, not crawl |
| `victorybeyondthecup-com` | owned | html-scrape | ~120 | campaign | **Framer-rendered**; multilingual sitemaps |
| `victory-host-kit` | owned | manual | ~14 files | campaign | Google Drive archive (allow-listed file IDs) |
| `nextstep-is` | partner | html-scrape | ~8 | **weak — campaign/tool** | thin WordPress; invite/prayer/easter/world-cup landing pages |
| `nextstep-support` | partner | html-scrape | — | **no — product docs** | Help Scout; explicitly *not* for spiritual/doctrinal answers |
| `nextstep-football2026` | partner | html-scrape | — | seasonal | **own subdomain** `football2026.nextstep.is`; the canonical FOLLOW-UP E exclusion fixture |
| `nextsteps-toolkit` | owned | manual | — | training | local-file import |
| `curated-references` | trusted | manual | — | mixed | staged YouTube/article JSON |
| `everystudent-com` | partner | html-scrape | ~7 seeds | yes — but **BLOCKED** | see hazards below |
| `issuesiface-com` | blocked | **blocked** | — | — | placeholder only; unstable host (www 404, 403/challenge) |

(Languages: `everystudent` has **51** sibling-language domains, `startingwithgod` **31**, in the JSON files. Deferred — English first.)

## Known hazards (we already paid to learn these)

- **Cloudflare / bot walls.** `everystudent-com`'s jfa entry says verbatim: *"Main
  site actively blocks bot traffic… returns 403 on many automated requests.
  Ingestion is via curated article lists, approved archives, or official exports."*
  Our 2026-05-25 probe confirmed it: homepage 200, **every content page 403 with a
  Cloudflare `challenge-platform` JS challenge** our plain undici fetcher can't pass
  (full record in `docs/slices/everystudent.md`). **jfa never cleanly solved this** —
  it relied on curated lists/archives/exports. Expect more of this; `cru.org`,
  `jesusfilm.org`, `nextstep.is`, `sightlineministry.org` all probed **clear** (200,
  no challenge), so it is source-specific, not systemic.
- **JS-rendered shells.** `knowgod-com` (Angular) and `victorybeyondthecup-com`
  (Framer) won't yield content to a plain HTML fetch — they need browser rendering
  or the underlying API.
- **Thin/marketing sites masquerading as content.** `nextstep-is` looked lean by
  homepage size but is ~8 product-marketing pages. **Lesson: probe a real *article*
  page + the sitemap, never just the homepage** — homepage-only recon gave false
  positives for both EveryStudent (reachability) and NextStep (richness).

## Two decisions deferred to "next time" (don't re-derive — decide these)

1. **Adopt jfa's discovery-crawl model?** The STATUS "generic crawler vs per-source"
   call (deferred until 2–3 sources reveal the pattern) is effectively **answered**:
   jfa's `seeds + allow + block + articleHints + contentSelectors + sitemaps` shape is
   the proven model and is required for any source above ~50 pages. Adopting it means
   extending our `CrawlPolicy` type + adding a discovery step to the Acquisition
   context (follow links from seeds; keep allow∧articleHints; drop block). **Trigger:
   the first large source (GotQuestions / Sightline / jesusfilm-org).** Until then,
   `cru-10-basic-steps` and other small curated scopes fit our current `seedPaths` code.
2. **Cloudflare-walled sources — what's the bypass?** Options, in rough order of
   cost: (a) curated archives / official exports (jfa's posture); (b) a Playwright/
   headless `Fetcher` adapter behind the existing port (executes the JS challenge —
   heavy dep, may still lose to a managed challenge); (c) authorized feed/API from the
   owner (EveryStudent is a Cru property). **Decide when a *walled* source becomes
   required coverage** — right now only EveryStudent (1 of the short list) is walled,
   so it stays `blocked` and we move on.

## What we're doing now (slice #2)

`cru-10-basic-steps` — 12 ready-made curated URLs from jfa, on our **current**
`seedPaths` model (no crawler rebuild). Cru is content-reachable. This proves the
2nd source end-to-end and unblocks per-source eval + FOLLOW-UP E. The two decisions
above are explicitly **not** taken in this slice.
