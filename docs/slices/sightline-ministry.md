# Slice: Sightline Ministry (sightline-ministry)

_Branch: `slice/sightline-ministry` · Started: 2026-05-27 · Status: done (2026-05-27)_
<!-- Status: in-progress | blocked | done -->

## Goal (architecture altitude)
Get Sightline Ministry (sightlineministry.org) queryable end-to-end: acquire →
ingest → retrieve → spot-check. This is **slice #4** and the first source to
**reuse the slice-#3 discovery-crawl machinery (FOLLOW-UP F) unchanged** — no new
acquisition code. Sightline is the same WordPress/Yoast shape as jesusfilm.org
(`sitemap_index.xml`, serves 200, empty `Disallow:`, no challenge wall — probed
2026-05-27). Its distinctive value is the **apologetics / skeptic / evidence** axis
(titles like "Doesn't believing in God require faith?", "Why does God seem hidden
from us?", "Three signs you've got the wrong god") — directly targeting the two
honest skeptic misses left open at the end of slice #3.

## Stages & sub-steps
`[x]` = done + verify-green + committed (sha). Resume at the first `[ ]`.

### 1. Acquire → raw_documents (reuse the discovery crawler)
- [x] 1a. Register `sightline-ministry` SourceEntry (content sitemaps per the budget
      decision below, `.o-longform-content__content` selector, allow/block/articleHints,
      maxPages) + registry test.            <!-- sha: 5903b2a -->
      <!-- partner discovery source seeding /post-sitemap.xml + /daily-devo-sitemap.xml; articleHints validated against live sitemaps (414 posts + 1000 devos kept, 2 index pages dropped); +2 registry tests (110 total). Verify green. -->

- [x] 1b. Live crawl → `raw_documents`; spot-read content is real apologetics prose,
      not nav/boilerplate. (Budget confirmed below before crawling.)            <!-- sha: 1b-commit -->
      <!-- Discovery: 2 sitemaps → 1392 unique kept (22 sitemap dups + 2 index pages dropped by the Set/filters). Crawl staged 1390/1392, 2 skipped too-thin (<250 chars). raw_documents: 1390 rows, all status 200, 0 null titles, 1390 distinct canonical_url, chars min 494 / avg 3429 / max 18993, 0 ingested. Spot-read: apologetics posts ("Is Christianity Intolerant?", "Doesn't Believing in God Require Faith?") = clean prose; shortest (494ch) is a reader testimonial (real, above floor). Full gate re-run green (110 tests). -->


### 2. Ingest → corpus tables
- [x] 2a. `pnpm index --source sightline-ministry` drains `raw_documents` →
      documents/chunks/embeddings; counts sane; 1:1 chunks:embeddings; idempotent
      re-run drains 0. **Re-run the FULL gate** (integration tests query live PG).            <!-- sha: 2a-commit -->
      <!-- Drained all 1390 → 1390 docs / 3470 chunks / 3470 embeddings (1:1, no null-embeds dropped). Single model openai/text-embedding-3-small; 0 chunk_count mismatches; chunks/doc min 1 / avg 2.5 / max 12 (devos lean ~1-2, apologetics 3-4+). Idempotent re-run drained 0. Full gate re-run GREEN (110 tests) — the 4x corpus growth did NOT break a fixture (slice #3 lesson held). Corpus now 4 sources. -->


### 3. Retrieve → ranked results
- [x] 3a. A real apologetics/skeptic query returns ranked, cited sightline hits in
      the now-4-source space; dedup intact; cross-source health checked.            <!-- sha: 3a-commit -->
      <!-- "Is Christianity intolerant…?" → Sightline's own "Is Christianity Intolerant?" RANK 1 (0.616), jf's at #2 — directly addresses the slice-#3 jf-skeptic-intolerant miss. "What proof God exists?" → 5 Sightline apologetics docs (0.647 top: first-cause/personal-experience/God-Delusion). "Blind faith?" → faith-apologetics incl. the exact doc. Cross-source HEALTH: "sure of heaven" → swg "How to Be Sure of Heaven" still #1 (0.677), swg 3/5; "begin a relationship with God" → swg "New Christian" #1 — other sources NOT drowned. minScore 0.37 HOLDS @ 4 sources: secular (index funds) 0 hits; faith-adjacent Quran/Ramadan top 0.389 (unchanged from slice #3, noise floor not raised). Dedup intact (distinct URLs). Note: Sightline has near-duplicate REPUBLISHED devotionals (annual re-runs, -2/-7 slugs) the 3-key dedup doesn't collapse (near-, not exact-dup) — citation-quality nit, candidate follow-up. Retrieval prebuilt + source-agnostic; no code change. -->


### 4. Spot-check / eval
- [x] 4a. `/golden sightline-ministry` (new skeptic-axis cases) + re-review living
      `relevant` maps (the set is living — slice #3 lesson); `pnpm eval` recall +
      coverage @ top-10; per-source breakdown across 4 sources. Re-check the 2
      slice-#3 skeptic misses now that Sightline is in the corpus.            <!-- sha: 4a-commit -->
      <!-- Drove /golden curation (operator approved all, 2026-05-27): Part A added Sightline docs to 14 existing cases' living relevant maps (6 skeptic + 8 seeker/believer/newcomer); Part B added 10 new Sightline skeptic-axis cases. All 55 credited Sightline paths verified present in corpus. qa-golden.yaml now 42 cases. -->

#### Stage 4 results (2026-05-27)
**Curated eval (4 sources, 42 cases, top-10):** recall@3 **0.810** · recall@10 **0.976** ·
coverage **0.583** · MRR **0.709** · P@1 **0.571**.
Per-source: jesusfilm-org **0.913/0.779** (n=23) · sightline-ministry **0.750/0.468** (n=24) ·
starting-with-god 0.611/0.419 (n=18) · cru-10-basic-steps 0.357/0.321 (n=14).

**vs. pre-curation (stale 32 cases @ 4 sources):** recall@3 0.688→**0.810**, P@1 0.375→**0.571**,
MRR 0.565→**0.709** — the curation credited the genuinely-relevant Sightline answers that the
stale maps were scoring as misses (the living-set artifact, resolved exactly as slice #3).
recall@10 0.969→0.976. Coverage 0.618→0.583 *fell* — expected and not a regression: crediting
Sightline grew many relevant sets (e.g. `sl-skeptic-god-exists` 5 relevant, `cru-skeptic-jesus-uniqueness`
6), and top-10 can't return all of an enlarged set, so the *fraction* returned drops while
recall@10 stays ~1.0 (every question still answered).

**Slice-#3 skeptic misses — re-checked:**
- ✅ `jf-skeptic-intolerant`: **rank 1** (Sightline's own "Is Christianity Intolerant?"), cov 3/4 —
  was rank 8 pre-curation / out-ranked in slice #3. **Closed by Sightline.**
- ⚠️ `jf-believer-disciple-making`: still a **miss** (rank=miss, 0/2) — the "grow in faith"↔"disciple"
  vocabulary gap. Not Sightline's domain (no disciple-making doc credited); left as the honest miss
  it was in slice #3. A candidate signal for hybrid/keyword search (FOLLOW-UP B).

**New Sightline cases (Part B):** all 10 are recall@10 hits; **8 of 10 rank 1**
(god-exists / suffering / science / morality / copycat / meaning / doubt / apologetics).
2 lower: `sl-skeptic-gospels-reliable` rank 5 (the 10-part "True Gospels" video series splits the
answer across many docs; only the credited subset returns in top-10) and `sl-skeptic-hidden-god`
rank 7. Sightline's apologetics axis is solidly findable (per-source recall 0.750).

**Honest finding — small-source crowding (FOLLOW-UP I/J signal, NOT a regression):**
cru (0.321) and swg (0.419) per-source coverage did **not** recover from pre-curation. Adding 1390
broad Sightline docs genuinely competes for top-10 slots on shared topics (assurance, prayer, gospel),
crowding the smaller sources' specific docs out of top-10 — even though the *question* is still
answered (recall@10 0.976). This is ranking-pure-engine behavior with an unbalanced corpus
(mechanism-not-policy, §1); the lever is consumer-side diversity (**FOLLOW-UP I** `maxPerSource`/MMR
→ [#15](https://github.com/JesusFilm/jesusfilm-rag/issues/15)) or large-corpus recall
(**FOLLOW-UP J** → [#17](https://github.com/JesusFilm/jesusfilm-rag/issues/17)), not an engine change here.

**minScore 0.37 HOLDS @ 4 sources (FOLLOW-UP A re-confirmed):** pure-secular negatives (index funds,
faucet) return 0 hits; faith/metaphor-adjacent peeks just above cutoff (cricket→"Who Makes the Calls?"
sports-metaphor devo **0.381**; Quran/Ramadan→jf fasting **0.389**) sit well below the 0.5–0.65 positive
cluster. Adding 1390 docs did not breach the floor; raising to 0.40 would cut genuine weak answers
(slice #3's weakest genuine was 0.383). No change.

**Negatives (cutoff calibration — NOT in qa-golden.yaml; eval.ts would miscount them as misses):**
- "What is the best way to invest in index funds for retirement?" → 0 hits ≥ 0.37
- "How do I fix a leaking kitchen faucet?" → 0 hits ≥ 0.37
- "What are the rules of cricket?" → top **0.381** (Sightline "Who Makes the Calls?" — umpire/authority metaphor)
- "What does the Quran teach about fasting during Ramadan?" → top **0.389** (jf "How Can I Get Closer to God", a fasting passage)

## Dry discovery (probed read-only, 2026-05-27)
`sitemap_index.xml` → 16 child sitemaps. URL counts per child:

| Sitemap | URLs | Content? | Selector |
|---|--:|---|---|
| `post-sitemap.xml` | 415 | **yes — apologetics/teaching posts** (`/<slug>/`) | `.o-longform-content__content` ✓ |
| `daily-devo-sitemap.xml` | 1001 | yes — daily devotionals (`/daily-devo/<slug>/`) | `.o-longform-content__content` ✓ |
| `resource-sitemap.xml` | 45 | hub pages (`/resources/<cat>/<slug>/`) | **card template** (`.o-principle-block`), not prose → excluded |
| `page-sitemap.xml` | 65 | mixed (about/contact/landing) — not teaching | — |
| `asset-sitemap.xml` | 470 | assets/media — not content | — |
| `post_tag` / `category` / `author` / `contributor` / `region` / `global-location` | 124/28/1/14/1/4 | taxonomy listings | — |
| `event` / `press-release` / `job-listing*` | 5/30/12+3 | not teaching | — |

(Each content sitemap also lists one bare index page — `/blog/`, `/daily-devotions/`,
`/resources/` — dropped by an `articleHints` slug filter.)

## Decisions made (this slice)
- 2026-05-27 — Source key is `sightline-ministry` (matches jfa curation).
- 2026-05-27 — Reuse slice #3's discovery crawler **unchanged**; Sightline is the
  same WP/Yoast shape as jesusfilm.org. No new acquisition code.
- 2026-05-27 — Scope by **seeding specific content sitemaps**, NOT the index + URL
  regex: posts live at bare-root `/<slug>/` (indistinguishable by path from
  `page`/`contact` entries), so seeding the index would pull asset (470), post_tag
  (124), category, author, event, job sitemaps. Seeding `post-sitemap.xml` (+ optionally
  `daily-devo-sitemap.xml`) scopes precisely to teaching content.
- 2026-05-27 — Resources (45) use a `.o-principle-block` card/hub template, not
  `.o-longform-content__content` — excluded (would extract as nav, not prose).
- 2026-05-27 — Crawl budget/scope: **posts + daily devotionals (~1,414)** — operator
  chose the broader scope (2026-05-27). Seed `post-sitemap.xml` (415 → 414 after
  dropping `/blog/`) + `daily-devo-sitemap.xml` (1001 → 1000 after dropping
  `/daily-devotions/`). `maxPages` 1600 (headroom). Resources still excluded
  (card template). Embedding $ trivial; ~35 min polite crawl at 1500ms.
- 2026-05-27 — Stage 4 eval driven via the repo `golden` skill workflow (operator
  approved "I drive it, you approve"); Part A re-reviewed 14 of 32 existing cases'
  living `relevant` maps (Sightline weighted to its apologetics strength; marginal
  matches skipped to avoid softballing) + Part B added 10 new Sightline skeptic-axis
  cases. All 55 credited paths verified present before the eval.
- 2026-05-27 — The cru/swg per-source coverage drop is **honest small-source crowding**,
  not a curation failure or retrieval regression — Sightline (1390 broad docs) competes
  for top-10 on shared topics. Recorded as a FOLLOW-UP I/J signal; no engine change
  (mechanism-not-policy). recall@10 0.976 confirms questions are still answered.

## Open question / blocker
- none — slice complete (all 4 stages green + evaluated, 2026-05-27).
- Note: discovery keeps **1,392 unique** articles, not 1,414 — the Yoast sitemaps
  contain 22 duplicate URLs (post 415→414 unique; devo 1001→980 unique), which
  `discoverUrls`'s `Set` correctly collapses (no double-indexing). 1,392 = 413
  posts (414 − `/blog/` index) + 979 devos (980 − `/daily-devotions/` index).
- Non-blocking follow-ups surfaced: (a) Sightline republishes devotionals annually
  (`-2`/`-7` slugs) → near-duplicate docs the 3-key dedup doesn't collapse
  (citation-quality, candidate dedup follow-up); (b) small-source crowding (cru/swg
  coverage) → FOLLOW-UP I/J; (c) `jf-believer-disciple-making` vocab-gap miss →
  FOLLOW-UP B hybrid/keyword search signal.

## Pre-curation eval (read-only, 2026-05-27 — the living-set artifact)
Whole-corpus `pnpm eval` on the **stale 32 cases** (no Sightline in any `relevant`
map yet) against the **4-source** corpus: recall@3 **0.688** · recall@10 **0.969** ·
coverage **0.618** · MRR 0.565 · P@1 0.375. Per-source: jf **0.913/0.779**
(unchanged) · swg 0.611/0.419 (was 0.833) · cru 0.357/0.321 (was 0.714). recall@10
*rose* to 0.969 — expected docs are still in top-10, just **displaced from top ranks**
by genuinely-relevant Sightline content. Classic stale-living-set artifact (slice #3:
0.85→0.938), **not** a retrieval regression. Fix = `/golden` curation, not an engine
change. (Wrote `eval/results-2026-05-27.md`; will be overwritten by the curated run.)

## Resume hint (for a cold start)
**DONE.** Slice #4 complete — all 4 stages green + evaluated. Sightline rode slice #3's
discovery crawler with zero new acquisition code: acquired 1390 → ingested 1390 docs /
3470 chunks / 3470 embeddings → retrievable + cited → evaluated (42-case curated eval:
recall@10 0.976, recall@3 0.810, coverage 0.583, sightline per-source recall 0.750).
Closed slice-#3's `jf-skeptic-intolerant` miss (now rank 1). minScore 0.37 holds @ 4
sources. Commits 1a `5903b2a` · 1b `35dc82a` · 2a `b34ffa9` · 3a `c966bd6` · stage-4 next.
Next: operator's call to merge `slice/sightline-ministry` → `main`, then `/slice <next>`.
Branch: slice/sightline-ministry.
