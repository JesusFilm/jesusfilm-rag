/**
 * The status contract — the SINGLE source of truth for the source-status
 * vocabulary, its human-facing descriptions, and the two derived views.
 *
 * Three trackers used to restate the status words independently (the
 * docs/source-status.yaml header, the /slice skill, docs/sources.md) and had
 * already drifted. This module collapses them into one definition:
 *
 *   - the deterministic writer (scripts/source-status.ts, the only sanctioned
 *     mutator) imports these enums + `deriveRowStatus` so it cannot invent or
 *     mis-assign a status;
 *   - tests/source-status.test.ts validates the COMMITTED file against the
 *     schema and the derivation (CI gate against tool bugs + stray hand-edits);
 *   - docs/sources.md keeps its richer lifecycle granularity, but only through
 *     `LifecycleLabel` (derived here), so the vocabularies can't diverge again.
 *
 * Schemas are runtime VALUES; paired types are derived via z.infer so a shape
 * changes in exactly one place. zod is external, so importing it here does not
 * violate the "contracts import nothing under src/" rule (.dependency-cruiser.cjs).
