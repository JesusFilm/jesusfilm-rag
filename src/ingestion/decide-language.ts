/**
 * decide-language — the per-document `documents.language` decision (#74;
 * thresholds + null policy recorded as ADR-0007, which supersedes ADR-0006's
 * low-confidence fallback). Pure policy over the pure detector, kept as its own primitive so
 * every consumer of the decision — the ingest path (normalize.ts) and the #73
 * corpus audit / null-backfill pass — shares one tested implementation instead
 * of re-encoding the thresholds.
 *
 * The decision, in order:
 *   1. cleaned content shorter than the detection floor → null. The only regime
 *      where tinyld is *confidently wrong* is sparse non-prose (name/title/date
 *      lists, nav) — every observed case < 260 chars; 500 clears them all.
 *   2. detector confidence below the gate → null (honestly unsure).
 *   3. otherwise trust the verdict — even OUTSIDE the source's declared
 *      `languages` (content wins). An out-of-set detection is still stored and
 *      carries a warning: the registry declaration is incomplete, or the
 *      detector misfired — either way an actionable operator signal.
 *
 * `null` always means "not confidently detected", never a guess: a blank row
 * stays fully retrievable unfiltered, is simply excluded from `language:<code>`
 * filters, and forms #73's worklist (`WHERE language IS NULL`).
