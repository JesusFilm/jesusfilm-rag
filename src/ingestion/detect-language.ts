/**
 * detect-language — content-based language detection for a document's cleaned
 * text. Pure, in-process, zero-I/O, free (no cloud/LLM). Wraps `tinyld`
 * (trigram/script detector), chosen by experiment over `franc` — see
 * ADR-0006: native ISO 639-1 output (matches `documents.language` directly, no
 * 639-3→639-1 map) and a *graded* confidence the gate can use.
 *
 * This module is the pure detection primitive only. The detection floor +
 * confidence gate + declared-set cross-check (what to do when there is too
 * little text, confidence is low, or the detected language falls outside
 * `source.languages`) lives in `decide-language.ts`, which owns the
 * `documents.language` decision (#74). If an LLM escalation is ever added for
 * genuinely ambiguous docs, that is I/O and MUST enter behind a
 * `LanguageDetector` port wired in `main.ts` — never imported here
 * (architecture §5). Detection stays a pure function in `ingestion`.
