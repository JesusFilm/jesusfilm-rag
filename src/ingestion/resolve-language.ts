/**
 * resolve-language — the #73 corpus-sweep language policy, layered ON TOP of the
 * pure per-document decision (`decide-language.ts`, #74). Where `decideLanguage`
 * answers "what does the content confidently say, else null?", `resolveLanguage`
 * answers the sweep's stronger question: "what language should this document's
 * column actually hold?" — where a `null` is the rare, deliberate exception, not
 * the default.
 *
 * The purpose of the sweep is that EVERY document ends up labelled with the
 * language it is actually in. `decideLanguage` is intentionally cautious and
 * emits `null` whenever it is unsure (below the 500-char floor or the 0.75
 * gate). That caution is right at ingest time, but for a whole-corpus correction
 * pass an unexplained `null` is a document that has silently dropped out of every
 * `language:<code>` filter. So this module keeps `decideLanguage`'s confident
 * verdicts verbatim and, only when it abstains, applies a safe fallback ladder:
 *
 *   1. `detected`             — decideLanguage returned a language (floor + gate
 *                               passed). Trust it verbatim, warning and all. This
 *                               is where the genuine relabels come from (e.g. a
 *                               French `thelife` article stamped `en`).
 *   2. `declared-monolingual` — decideLanguage abstained, but the source declares
 *                               exactly ONE language. A short/ambiguous page on a
 *                               single-language source is almost certainly in that
 *                               language, so fall back to it. (Residual risk: a
 *                               SHORT foreign page on a monolingual source — #73's
 *                               known blind spot — which is why every fallback is
 *                               sampled into the report for a human to eyeball.)
 *   3. `declared-primary`     — decideLanguage abstained (below the gate OR below
 *                               the floor) on a MULTI-language source, but the
 *                               detector's dominant candidate is INSIDE the declared
 *                               set. Take it — even on a short page. The floor
 *                               guards against confidently-wrong short text, but
 *                               every observed such case was OUT-of-set (Hindi on an
 *                               English listing); an in-set call is the best evidence
 *                               and a real label beats a null (#73). Reported for review.
 *   4. `unresolved-null`      — a multi-language source whose detection is OUT of the
 *                               declared set or undetectable (any length). These are
 *                               the genuine misfires; guessing would re-introduce the
 *                               exact `languages[0]` mislabel #73 exists to fix, so we
 *                               honestly leave `null` (LLM-escalation candidates). THIS
 *                               is the documented exception, highlighted at the end of
 *                               every report.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O. The ladder itself (`resolveFromSignals`) is separated from the
 * detector calls so every branch is deterministically unit-testable without
 * depending on tinyld's exact scores. The sweep script owns DB reads, the
 * transaction, the change log and the report; this module only decides.

 *   • When a weak signal disagrees with the kept label, the document is flagged
