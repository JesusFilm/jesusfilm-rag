/**
 * The `everystudent-bn` registry entry — EveryStudent's Bengali domain
 * (everybengalistudent.com). Split out of `registry.test.ts` (the §5.5 300-line
 * cap), following `everystudent-pl.test.ts` / `everystudent-sq.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each guard below pins a decision that took live measurement to reach, so a
 * future edit cannot quietly undo it:
 *   - plain HTTP, NOT Firecrawl — this banner is not walled;
 *   - a SEPARATE key from `everystudent`, because one domain = one source;
 *   - discovery, not hand-listed seeds, because the sitemap is reachable and is
 *     a strict superset of the site's own HTML map;
 *   - `contentSelectors: [".contentpadding"]` alone — `.content4` MATCHES on
 *     55 of 57 pages and extracts 0 chars, so listing it would shadow the real
 *     container and ingest nothing;
 *   - `/a/whowas.html` blocked as the complete Gospel of John, carrying a
 *     third-party Tyndale/NLT licence;
 *   - `/a/` only — the `/m/` indexes, the site map, the contact form and the
 *     homepage all clear the 250-char floor, so `minContentLength` could never
 *     have excluded them.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
