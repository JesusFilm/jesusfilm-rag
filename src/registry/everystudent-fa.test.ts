/**
 * The `everystudent-fa` registry entry — EveryStudent's Persian/Farsi domain
 * (everypersianstudent.com). Split out of `registry.test.ts` (the §5.5 300-line
 * cap), following `everystudent-ru.test.ts` / `everystudent-fr.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each guard below pins a decision that took live measurement to reach, so a
 * future edit cannot quietly undo it:
 *   - plain HTTP, NOT Firecrawl — this banner is not walled (thelife's Persian
 *     shagerdan.com is a DIFFERENT host, and that one is);
 *   - a SEPARATE key from `everystudent`, because one domain = one source;
 *   - discovery, not hand-listed seeds, because the sitemap is reachable and
 *     the site's own HTML map adds nothing to it;
 *   - `/a/` only — the 21 Gospel-of-John chapters, the `/m/` indexes,
 *     `/sitemap.html`, `/contact.html`, `/a/fol.html` and the homepage ALL
 *     clear the 250-char floor, so `minContentLength` could never exclude them;
 *   - `contentSelectors` is the single measured container, because the shared
 *     `.content4` extracts 0 chars here and would shadow it.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
