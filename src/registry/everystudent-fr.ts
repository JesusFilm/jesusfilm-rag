/**
 * EveryStudent — French (questions2vie.com). The French banner of Cru's
 * seeker-facing Q&A ministry: short apologetics/life-issue articles aimed at
 * French-speaking students who are not believers. Slice #10; planned in #112.
 *
 * **The third and final walled EveryStudent domain**, closing the #112 route
 * (en → ar → fr).
 *
 * **A separate SOURCE KEY, not a language of `everystudent`** — one domain =
 * one source (ADR-0006). questions2vie.com is its own domain, so it gets its
 * own key, the same way `thelife-fr` (laviejenparle.com) and `thelife-zh`
 * (uwota.com) are separate from `thelife`.
 *
 * **WALLED (ADR-0012), like both siblings.** Probed 2026-07-27: the homepage,
 * a real article (`/a/102rien.html`) and `/sitemap.xml` all return **403**
 * carrying the Cloudflare block-page signature (`<title>Attention Required! |
 * Cloudflare</title>`), and only `robots.txt` answers plain HTTP. So
 * `fetchStrategy: "firecrawl"` — every request this source makes is billed per
 * page (measured 1 credit/page across all three EveryStudent hosts in #114,
 * because Firecrawl's `basic` proxy clears them and `auto` never escalates to
 * the 5-credit enhanced retry; re-measure before any large re-crawl).
 *
 * Classification note: the wall was called on the **block-page signature**, not
 * on the presence of a `challenge-platform` script — Cloudflare injects that
 * into successfully-served pages too, so keying off it false-positives (#114).
 *
 * **Hand-listed seeds, not a discovery crawl** — same reasoning as both
 * siblings, and the same already-paid inventory. `/sitemap.xml` is unreachable
 * to plain HTTP, and #114 already enumerated this domain through Firecrawl's
 * `/v2/map` (87 URLs, 1 credit flat, full list preserved as a comment on that
 * issue). Re-discovering would re-pay for knowledge we already hold, so the
 * mapped inventory is lifted here directly. `sitemaps` is intentionally absent.
 *
 * **67 seeds from the 87 mapped** — the whole `/a/` article body, and nothing else. Dropped:
 *   - the **12 `/m/*` pages** — the mobile/menu section indexes (`enigmes`,
 *     `existence`, `experience`, `faq`, `intl`, `jesus`, `lavie`, `legales`,
 *     `qetr`, `qui`, `relations`, `videos`). #112's crawl policy strips `/m/`,
 *     `/menu/`, `/menus/` across all three banners; these are navigation, not
 *     articles. `/m/intl.html` is also the page linking out to the sibling
 *     language domains — dropped for the same reason the English entry drops
 *     `/menus/intl.html`.
 *   - **`/plan.html`** — the "plan du site" sitemap page, the French twin of
 *     the `/sitemap.html` the English entry drops.
 *   - **`/contact1.html`** — contact chrome.
 *   - the **two `.php` extension twins**, `/aventure.php` and `/jean.php`. Each
 *     shares a slug with a `.html` page already seeded; a legacy site serving
 *     one page at two extensions is the likeliest reading, and the document-level
 *     content hash cannot collapse duplicates that sit at different URLs — so
 *     seeding both would pay a credit to add a near-duplicate document. If the
 *     `.html` twin turns out to be a redirect stub at Stage 1, revisit.
 *   - the bare homepage.
 *   - the **3 root-level email-signup landing pages** (`/jean.html`,
 *     `/jeanFR.html`, `/aventure.html`) — seeded provisionally, fetched, then
 *     dropped on the evidence below.
 * No `block` array: `block` filters DISCOVERED urls, and a seed-only source
 * discovers none — the seed list itself is the filter. Anything added later must
 * be re-checked against robots.txt by hand.
 *
 * **`/jean.html`, `/jeanFR.html` and `/aventure.html` were seeded provisionally
 * and are now DROPPED — measured at Stage 1, they are email-signup landing
 * pages, not articles.** All three cleared `minContentLength` comfortably
 * (1,949 / 2,020 / 2,453 ch), which is exactly why the floor could not decide
 * this: length is not aboutness. What the fetch revealed:
 *   - `/jean.html` and `/jeanFR.html` share **87.9% of their 12-word shingles**
 *     — the same sign-up page for a Gospel-of-John email study with sentences
 *     reordered. That sits in the same band as the 93.8% podcast/article overlap
 *     the English entry drops, and the document-level content hash cannot
 *     collapse near-duplicates that live at different URLs.
 *   - all three end in an **identical 850-char French GDPR privacy notice**
 *     (Agapé France, loi « informatique et libertés ») — 44% / 42% / 35% of
 *     their bodies. It is the only text the three share, and it would embed as
 *     noise in a seeker Q&A corpus.
 *   - what remains is form copy ("S'inscrire ici", unsubscribe terms), not a
 *     seeker question being answered.
 * The 3 credits are spent and not recoverable, but the seeds are removed so a
 * re-crawl does not re-pay for them, and the rows were deleted before ingest.
 *
 * ⓘ **The Arabic banner's `/john.html` and `/pack.html` are the SAME two pages**
 * (the John email study and the "Spiritual Adventure" 7-email series), kept in
 * slice #9 on the same provisional call and **live in prod today**. Recorded as
 * an observation for a future estate-wide cleanup; slice #10 does not touch prod.
 *
 * **robots.txt is `User-agent: * Allow: /`** — checked live 2026-07-27. Same as
 * everyarabstudent.com and UNLIKE everystudent.com, which carries a real
 * disallow list (`/4laws.html`, `/team/*`, `/mobi/*`, …). Nothing on this domain
 * is disallowed, so no seed needed dropping on robots grounds.
 *
 * **Extraction.** `.content4` / `.content4b` (plus `.articletitle`,
 * `.contentpadding`) — #112 records the same template across all three walled
 * banners and the 48 non-walled siblings (#111), and `.content4` was **measured
 * binding** on the Arabic host at slice #9's Stage 1. The strip list mirrors both
 * sibling entries: `sitelevel_noindex` (share links + related cards) and
 * `.fccell` (the "FEATURE CLOSE" call-to-action table appended to every
 * article), which together removed ~275-360 chars of pure chrome per page on the
 * English host. Verify the selectors bind on the first French fetch.
 *
 * **Language: `["fr"]` — declared, not assumed.** All 87 mapped URLs sit under
 * one French banner, and #114 sampled `/a/102rien.html` as genuine French. The
 * stored per-document label still comes from content detection at ingest
 * (invariant 6), never from this field.
 *
 * ⚠️ **French is NOT a new language for this corpus** — unlike slice #9's
 * Arabic. 159 `fr` documents already exist (`thelife-fr` 156, `thelife` 2,
 * `cru` 1) and 10 French golden cases (`tlfr-*`) resolve to `fr` without an
 * explicit pin. So this source's documents are **eligible by construction** on
 * those existing cases: Stage-4 Part A re-review is real work here, and French
 * becomes a MULTI-source language for gating purposes.
 *
 * `requestDelayMs` is modest because Firecrawl fronts the requests: the
 * politeness that matters is Firecrawl's own egress, and each scrape already
 * takes seconds.
