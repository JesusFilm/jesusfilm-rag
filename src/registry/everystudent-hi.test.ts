/**
 * The `everystudent-hi` registry entry — EveryStudent's Hindi domain
 * (everystudent.in). Split out of `registry.test.ts` (the §5.5 300-line cap),
 * following the sibling `everystudent-*.test.ts` files.
 *
 * Each guard below pins a decision that took live measurement on 2026-07-30 to
 * reach, so a future edit cannot quietly undo it:
 *   - plain HTTP, NOT Firecrawl — this banner is Cloudflare-fronted but serves
 *     no block page, and declaring a strategy would bill a wall that isn't there;
 *   - a SEPARATE key from `everystudent`, because one domain = one source;
 *   - discovery PLUS four pinned seeds, because the XML sitemap omits four
 *     articles the site's own /m/map.html lists;
 *   - `.contentpadding` FIRST and `.content4` nowhere, because the empty
 *     `.content4` wrapper matches on all 34 articles at 0 chars and would
 *     shadow every selector after it;
 *   - `/bible.html` blocked as Scripture while `/a/bible.html` is kept as an
 *     essay about the Bible — an anchoring decision one loosened regex undoes.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
