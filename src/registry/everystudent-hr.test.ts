/**
 * The `everystudent-hr` registry entry — EveryStudent's Croatian domain
 * (vrlovazno.com). Split out of `registry.test.ts` (the §5.5 300-line cap),
 * following `everystudent-sr.test.ts` / `everystudent-sq.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each guard below encodes a decision that took live measurement to reach, so a
 * future edit cannot quietly undo it:
 *   - plain HTTP, NOT Firecrawl — this host is not walled, and the Cloudflare
 *     Turnstile script on two form pages is a CAPTCHA, not a bot wall;
 *   - a SEPARATE key from `everystudent` AND from the Serbian neighbour, whose
 *     text overlaps this host's by under 1%;
 *   - `.contentpadding` alone, because `.content4` matches 39 of the 41 articles
 *     and extracts 0 chars on every one of them;
 *   - the URL blocks for the two email-series signups and the `/a/` form page,
 *     none of which minContentLength can catch;
 *   - the share/CTA chrome strip that keeps citations clean.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
