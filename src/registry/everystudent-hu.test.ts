/**
 * The `everystudent-hu` registry entry — EveryStudent's Hungarian domain
 * (everystudent.hu). Split out of `registry.test.ts` (the §5.5 300-line cap),
 * following `everystudent-ru.test.ts` / `everystudent-de.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each guard below pins a decision that took live measurement to reach, so a
 * future edit cannot quietly undo it:
 *   - plain HTTP, NOT Firecrawl — this banner is not walled, and adding a
 *     strategy here would bill 83 pages for a wall that isn't there;
 *   - a SEPARATE key from `everystudent`, because one domain = one source;
 *   - discovery, not hand-listed seeds, because the sitemap is reachable AND
 *     complete (cross-checked against the site's own HTML map);
 *   - `/a/` AND `/story/` — the testimonies are corpus, the indexes are not,
 *     and 11 of the 13 excluded pages clear the 250-char floor, so
 *     `minContentLength` could never have excluded them;
 *   - `.contentpadding` ALONE, because the empty `.content4` spacer would
 *     shadow it and silently extract nothing.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
