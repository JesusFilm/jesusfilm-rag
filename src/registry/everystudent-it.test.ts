/**
 * The `everystudent-it` registry entry — EveryStudent's Italian domain
 * (ognistudente.com). Split out of `registry.test.ts` (the §5.5 300-line cap),
 * following `everystudent-sq.test.ts` / `everystudent-pl.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each guard below pins a decision that took live measurement to reach, so a
 * future edit cannot quietly undo it:
 *   - plain HTTP, NOT Firecrawl — this banner is not walled;
 *   - a SEPARATE key from `everystudent`, because one domain = one source;
 *   - discovery, not hand-listed seeds — the XML sitemap is complete, and the
 *     only four on-site URLs it lacks are 301s to pages already in it;
 *   - `contentSelectors: [".post-content"]` and nothing else. This host is
 *     **WordPress 6.7.5 / theme sight2016**, not the FreeFind template every
 *     sibling uses; all seven previously-catalogued container classes are 0
 *     matches here, and copying them in "as fallbacks" is the exact mistake
 *     that broke five pilot entries;
 *   - the robots.txt Disallow on `/personalmente2/`, which the acquire path
 *     does not enforce for us;
 *   - the flat-permalink shape of `articleHints`, which is what keeps the six
 *     `/category/` indexes and the homepage out structurally.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
