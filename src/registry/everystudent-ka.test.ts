/**
 * The `everystudent-ka` registry entry — EveryStudent's Georgian domain
 * (kovelistudenti.com). Split out of `registry.test.ts` (the §5.5 300-line cap),
 * following `everystudent-it.test.ts` / `everystudent-sq.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each guard below pins a decision that took live measurement to reach, so a
 * future edit cannot quietly undo it:
 *   - plain HTTP, NOT Firecrawl — this banner is not walled;
 *   - a SEPARATE key from `everystudent`, because one domain = one source;
 *   - discovery, not hand-listed seeds — the XML sitemap is an 8-year-old file
 *     that nevertheless matches the site's own HTML map exactly;
 *   - `contentSelectors: [".contentpadding", "html"]`. `.content4` is an ID on
 *     this host (`#content4`), which is the single character that made #111
 *     flag it as having no shared-template selectors — and `.articletitle`
 *     MATCHES here while yielding only the 5-62-char `<h1>`, so adding it would
 *     shadow the real container;
 *   - the robots.txt Disallow on `/a/fol.html`, which the acquire path does not
 *     enforce for us;
 *   - the block on `/a/omi216.html`, a 301 to the homepage.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
