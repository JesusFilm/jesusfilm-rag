/**
 * The `everystudent-kk` registry entry — EveryStudent's Kazakh domain
 * (shakirtter.com). Split out of `registry.test.ts` (the §5.5 300-line cap),
 * following the sibling `everystudent-*.test.ts` files.
 *
 * Each guard below pins a decision that took live measurement to reach, so a
 * future edit cannot quietly undo it:
 *   - plain HTTP, NOT Firecrawl — this banner is bare Apache, not walled;
 *   - a SEPARATE key from `everystudent` and from the Cyrillic `ru` sibling,
 *     because one domain = one source (ADR-0006);
 *   - `["html"]` ALONE, because `.content4` and `.container2` both match on
 *     17/17 articles at 0 chars and would shadow anything listed after them;
 *   - the robots.txt Disallow enforced BY URL, because acquire does not read
 *     robots.txt;
 *   - a `/baylanis.html` block anchored at the host root, so it cannot swallow
 *     the real 17,294-char article at `/a/baylanis.html`;
 *   - an `articleHints` regex that survives a Cyrillic or mixed-case slug.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
