/**
 * The `everystudent-lt` registry entry — EveryStudent's Lithuanian domain
 * (kiekvienamstudentui.lt). Split out of `registry.test.ts` (the §5.5 300-line
 * cap), following the sibling `everystudent-*.test.ts` files.
 *
 * Each guard below pins a decision that took live measurement to reach, so a
 * future edit cannot quietly undo it:
 *   - plain HTTP, NOT Firecrawl — this banner is not walled, and adding a
 *     strategy would bill every page for a wall that isn't there;
 *   - a SEPARATE key from `everystudent`, because one domain = one source;
 *   - discovery, not hand-listed seeds, because the sitemap is reachable and
 *     is a superset of the site's own HTML map;
 *   - `["html"]` alone, because `.content4` and `.content4b` both MATCH on this
 *     host and both extract 0 chars, which would silently skip every page;
 *   - the robots.txt block, which is the ONLY thing enforcing that rule;
 *   - the nav/chrome blocks, none of which minContentLength can catch.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
