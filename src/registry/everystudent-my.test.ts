/**
 * The `everystudent-my` registry entry — EveryStudent's Burmese domain
 * (everymyanmarstudent.com). Split out of `registry.test.ts` (the §5.5 300-line
 * cap), following `everystudent-sq.test.ts` / `everystudent-pl.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each guard below pins a decision that took live measurement to reach, so a
 * future edit cannot quietly undo it:
 *   - plain HTTP, NOT Firecrawl — this banner is not walled;
 *   - a SEPARATE key from `everystudent`, because one domain = one source;
 *   - discovery, not hand-listed seeds, because the sitemap is reachable and the
 *     site's own HTML map is an exact match for it;
 *   - `.contentpadding` FIRST with `.content4` absent — `.content4` matches 30
 *     of the 31 articles and extracts 0 chars on all 30, so listing it would
 *     shadow the real container and ingest nothing;
 *   - `"html"` LAST, which is the only thing rescuing `/a/prayers.html`;
 *   - the two robots.txt Disallows, one of which names an `/a/` article path;
 *   - `/m/`, contact, site plan and homepage, all of which clear the 250 floor.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
