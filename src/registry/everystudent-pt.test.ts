/**
 * The `everystudent-pt` registry entry — EveryStudent's Brazilian-Portuguese
 * domain (suaescolha.com). Split out of `registry.test.ts` (the §5.5 300-line
 * cap), following `everystudent.test.ts` / `everystudent-fr.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each guard below encodes a decision that took live measurement to reach, so a
 * future edit cannot quietly undo it:
 *   - plain HTTP, NOT Firecrawl — this is the one EveryStudent sibling that is
 *     not walled, and adding a `fetchStrategy` would start billing per page for
 *     nothing;
 *   - a SEPARATE key from `everystudent`, because one domain = one source;
 *   - discovery mode, because the sitemap is free to fetch;
 *   - the 13 pinned articles that cover the stale sitemap's 17% blind spot —
 *     the single most silently-losable fact in this entry;
 *   - the measured content selectors and the share/CTA chrome strip.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
