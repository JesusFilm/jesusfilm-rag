/**
 * The `everystudent-ru-ca` registry entry — EveryStudent's Central-Asian
 * Russian domain (studentstan.com).
 *
 * Every guard here encodes a decision that cost real measurement and would be
 * silent and expensive to undo. The load-bearing one is the seed list: this
 * host is a **mirror** of the already-acquired `everystudent-ru`, so the entry
 * exists only to carry the handful of articles that are NOT duplicates. If a
 * future change "completes" the seed list from the site's own map, it silently
 * adds ~81 near-duplicate Russian articles that the ingest dedup gate cannot
 * catch, because that gate keys on `(sourceKey, canonicalUrl)`.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
