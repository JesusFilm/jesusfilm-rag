/**
 * The `everystudent-sl` registry entry — EveryStudent's Slovenian domain
 * (vsakstudent.com). Split out of `registry.test.ts` (the §5.5 300-line cap),
 * following `everystudent-sq.test.ts` / `everystudent-pl.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each guard below pins a decision that took live measurement to reach, so a
 * future edit cannot quietly undo it:
 *   - `#contentpadding` is an **ID** on this host, not the estate's
 *     `.contentpadding` class — and none of the ten known generators match at
 *     all, so an inherited selector list would ingest nothing;
 *   - `/a/spoznatiboga2.html` is seeded because it is in NEITHER the XML
 *     sitemap nor the site's own HTML map, and only href-harvesting found it;
 *   - `/janez.html` is the verbatim Gospel of John under a Slovenian Bible
 *     Society copyright — scripture policy plus a rights-misattribution risk;
 *   - `.hidden` is CONTENT here (7,328 chars of evidence tables), not chrome;
 *   - a SEPARATE key from `everystudent`, because one domain = one source.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
