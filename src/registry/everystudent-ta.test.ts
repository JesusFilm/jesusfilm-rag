/**
 * The `everystudent-ta` registry entry — EveryStudent's Tamil domain
 * (ungalthervuenna.com). Split out of `registry.test.ts` (the §5.5 300-line
 * cap), following `everystudent-sq.test.ts` / `everystudent-pl.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each guard below pins a decision that took live measurement on 2026-07-30 to
 * reach, so a future edit cannot quietly undo it:
 *   - plain HTTP, NOT Firecrawl — this banner is not walled;
 *   - a SEPARATE key from `everystudent`, because one domain = one source;
 *   - discovery, not hand-listed seeds — and specifically NOT seeding the three
 *     `/a/` URLs the site's own nav links, because all three are 404;
 *   - `contentSelectors: ["html"]` and nothing else — `.content4` MATCHES on
 *     31/31 articles and extracts 0 chars, so listing it anywhere shadows the
 *     real container and ingests nothing;
 *   - `/a/` only — the `/m/` indexes, `/contact.html` and the homepage all clear
 *     the 250-char floor, so `minContentLength` could never have excluded them;
 *   - the strip list, which is what makes an `<html>` container usable at all.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
