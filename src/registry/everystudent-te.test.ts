/**
 * The `everystudent-te` registry entry — EveryStudent's Telugu domain
 * (everytelugustudent.com). Split out of `registry.test.ts` (the §5.5 300-line
 * cap), following `everystudent-bn.test.ts` / `everystudent-sq.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each guard below pins a decision that took live measurement to reach, so a
 * future edit cannot quietly undo it:
 *   - plain HTTP, NOT Firecrawl — this banner is not walled;
 *   - a SEPARATE key from `everystudent`, because one domain = one source;
 *   - discovery off the live sitemap, plus ONE pinned seed the maps both omit;
 *   - `contentSelectors: ["html"]` alone — `.content4` MATCHES on 30/30 pages
 *     and extracts 0 chars, so listing it would shadow the only real container
 *     and ingest nothing;
 *   - `/a/whowas.html` blocked as the abridged Gospel of John, carrying a
 *     third-party Tyndale/NLT licence;
 *   - `/a/` only — the `/m/` indexes, the contact form and the homepage all
 *     clear the 250-char floor, so `minContentLength` could never exclude them.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
