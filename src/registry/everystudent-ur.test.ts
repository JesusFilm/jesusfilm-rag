/**
 * The `everystudent-ur` registry entry — EveryStudent's Urdu domain
 * (zindagikaysawalat.com). Split out of `registry.test.ts` (the §5.5 300-line
 * cap), following `everystudent-fa.test.ts` / `everystudent-sq.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each guard below pins a decision that took live measurement to reach, so a
 * future edit cannot quietly undo it:
 *   - plain HTTP, NOT Firecrawl — this banner is not walled;
 *   - a SEPARATE key from `everystudent`, because one domain = one source;
 *   - discovery, not hand-listed seeds, because the XML sitemap and the site's
 *     own HTML map agree on all 33 articles with zero delta either way;
 *   - `contentSelectors: [".contentpadding"]` and NOTHING else — `.content4`
 *     matches on 32 of 33 articles and extracts 0 chars, so listing it would
 *     shadow the real container and silently ingest nothing;
 *   - `/a/` only — `/a/fol.html`, the `/m/` indexes, the contact form and the
 *     homepage all clear the 250-char floor, so `minContentLength` could never
 *     have excluded them.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
