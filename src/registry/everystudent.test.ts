/**
 * The `everystudent` registry entry — EveryStudent's English domain, and the
 * repo's first WALLED source (ADR-0012). Split out of `registry.test.ts` (the
 * §5.5 300-line cap), following `cru.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each guard below encodes a decision that cost real money or real corpus
 * quality to reach, so a future edit cannot quietly undo it:
 *   - the Firecrawl strategy (without it every page is a Cloudflare 403);
 *   - seed-only, because discovery was already paid for (#114);
 *   - no `/podcasts/` (measured 93.8% duplicates of `/wires/` articles);
 *   - robots.txt compliance, which `block` structurally cannot enforce here;
 *   - the CTA/share chrome strip that keeps citations clean.
 * Pure data + lookups, no I/O.
