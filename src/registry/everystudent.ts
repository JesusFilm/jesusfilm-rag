/**
 * EveryStudent — English (everystudent.com). Cru's seeker-facing Q&A site:
 * short apologetics/life-issue articles aimed at students who are not
 * believers. Slice #8; planned in #112.
 *
 * **The first WALLED source (ADR-0012).** everystudent.com serves a Cloudflare
 * JS managed challenge that our undici fetcher cannot pass (clearing it needs
 * JS execution to earn the `cf_clearance` cookie), so this entry declares
 * `fetchStrategy: "firecrawl"` — verified working against this domain
 * unmodified (#114). The wall has TIGHTENED since the 2026-05-25 probe: the
 * homepage and `/sitemap.xml` now 403 as well, and only `robots.txt` answers
 * plain HTTP. Every request this source makes is therefore billed per page
 * (measured 1 credit/page, not the 5 a walled page bills in general — Firecrawl's
 * `basic` proxy clears this host so `auto` never escalates; re-measure before
 * any large re-crawl).
 *
 * **Hand-listed seeds, not a discovery crawl** — deliberately, on cost grounds.
 * `/sitemap.xml` is unreachable to plain HTTP, and #114 already paid to
 * enumerate the site via Firecrawl's `/v2/map` (167 URLs, 1 credit flat, full
 * inventory preserved as a comment on that issue). Re-discovering would re-pay
 * for knowledge we already hold, so the mapped inventory is lifted here
 * directly. `sitemaps` is intentionally absent.
 *
 * **117 seeds from the 167 mapped.** Dropped as non-article chrome: the
 * homepage, `/contact.php`, `/donate`, `/quiz`, `/sitemap.html`, the bare
 * `/podcasts` index, 10 `/menus/*` section indexes, and the two `search.html`
 * pages. Dropped as DUPLICATES: all 32 `/podcasts/*` pages — each is an audio
 * read-aloud of an article that already exists under `/wires/` or `/features/`,
 * with the transcript inlined ("LISTEN TO ARTICLE: <title>" … "Transcript:").
 * Measured 2026-07-24: `/podcasts/loneliness.html` shares **93.8%** of its
 * 12-word shingles with `/wires/loneliness.html`; 18 of the 32 carry an exact
 * article slug twin and most of the rest are renames (`whowas` ↔
 * `who-was-jesus`, `isthere` ↔ `is-there-a-god`, `political-views` ↔
 * `the-politics-of-jesus`). Ingesting them would have paid 32 credits to add 32
 * near-duplicate documents the doc-level content hash cannot collapse.
 * `/videos/*` are KEPT: probed and found to be genuine unique testimony
 * transcripts, not media stubs (`/videos/lacey-sturm.html`, ~4.1k chars, has no
 * article twin) — though the handful with a `-video` suffix may echo their
 * article counterpart; check at Stage 4.
 *
 * **robots.txt honoured** — `/4laws.html`, `/jdquestions.html`, `/team/*`,
 * `/admin/*`, `/mobi/*`, `/sys/*`, `/mypage/*`, `/atools/*`, `/email/*` and the
 * contact pages are disallowed. None of them appear in the seed list (checked
 * against the live robots.txt 2026-07-24). No `block` array is declared because
 * it would be dead config: `block` filters DISCOVERED urls, and a seed-only
 * source never discovers any — the seed list itself is the filter. Anything
 * added here later must be re-checked against robots.txt by hand.
 *
 * **Extraction.** `.content4` / `.content4b` (plus `.articletitle`,
 * `.contentpadding`) — the same template as the 48 non-walled sibling domains
 * (#111). The strip list is tuned beyond the usual boilerplate: `sitelevel_noindex`
 * (the site's own "do not index" wrapper around share links and related-article
 * cards) and `.fccell` (the "FEATURE CLOSE" call-to-action table — "I just asked
 * Jesus into my life…", "I have a question or comment…" — appended verbatim to
 * every article). Both were measured stripping ~275–360 chars of pure chrome per
 * page and leaving articles ending cleanly on their own last line. This is the
 * slice-#2 accordion-TOC citation-quality problem handled at the source.
 *
 * **Language: `["en"]` — declared, not assumed.** All 167 mapped URLs are
 * English; the Arabic (everyarabstudent.com) and French (questions2vie.com)
 * banners are separate DOMAINS and therefore separate source keys and separate
 * slices (ADR-0006), and `/menus/intl.html` — the page linking out to them — is
 * dropped as an index page. The stored per-document label still comes from
 * content detection at ingest (invariant 6), never from this field.
 *
 * `requestDelayMs` is modest because Firecrawl fronts the requests: the politeness
 * that matters is Firecrawl's own egress, and each scrape already takes seconds.
