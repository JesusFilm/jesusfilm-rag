/**
 * FamilyLife (familylife.com) — slice #6. Cru's marriage & family ministry,
 * WordPress VIP (Automattic enterprise hosting). Probed 2026-06-03: 200,
 * empty challenge wall, open robots (`Disallow: /wp-admin/` only). Adds the
 * marriage/parenting teaching axis the 5-source corpus currently under-serves.
 *
 * **Fourth source to reuse slice #3's discovery-crawl machinery
 * (FOLLOW-UP F) with no new acquisition code** — same WordPress shape as
 * jesusfilm.org/sightline; differs from thelife (Statamic). The sitemap index
 * is `/sitemaps.xml` and lists 30 child sitemaps spanning posts, pages,
 * podcasts, and sub-brands (Art of Marriage, Blended, Stepping Up, Weekend
 * to Remember, Missions, Equip, Global, AOP, etc.).
 *
 * **Scope (operator-locked 2026-06-03, Scope A): "posts only"** — the
 * three post-sitemaps (the WordPress "post" content type) total **~2,330
 * URLs**: post-sitemap1 (939: 783 /articles/ + 155 /equip/ + 1 homepage),
 * post-sitemap2 (997 /articles/), post-sitemap3 (394 /articles/). We seed
 * these three child sitemaps directly rather than the index, sightline-style,
 * so we don't have to filter out 27 unrelated sub-brand sitemaps.
 *
 * The `/equip/` URLs in post-sitemap1 (155) are FamilyLife Equip teaching
 * content — mentoring, discipleship-of-a-new-Christian, leaving-an-abusive-
 * relationship, etc. — using the same WP post template + the same
 * `.the-content` selector as `/articles/`. They're kept (Scope A intent =
 * "all WP posts in the post-sitemap"); operator re-confirms at 1b dry
 * discovery. The separate `familylife-equip-sitemap1.xml` (custom post type)
 * is intentionally NOT seeded — that's sub-brand territory for a future
 * `familylife-equip` scoped sub-key per the Cru pattern.
 *
 * Content selectors verified on samples 2026-06-03: `<div class="the-content">`
 * is the innermost prose container inside `<div class="single-content
 * single-post-content">`; same wrapper on both `/articles/` and `/equip/`.
 * Sample article ~300 KB raw (heavy theme: nav, sidebar, related-posts CTAs,
 * social widgets — `stripSelectors` carries the load).
