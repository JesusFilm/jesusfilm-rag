/**
 * GotQuestions.org — English slice of a same-domain multilingual source.
 *
 * The site publishes a flat English sitemap: both answer articles and navigation
 * pages use `/<slug>.html`, so discovery needs an explicit negative policy for
 * known index/utility families. The dry-discovery checkpoint audits the complete
 * kept set before any crawl budget is approved.
 *
 * Translations also live on this domain (`/Arabic/`, `/Francais/`, etc.). They
 * deliberately remain outside this English policy for now, but will extend this
 * SAME source key through the later multilingual campaign. Language is always
 * detected from extracted document content at ingest.
