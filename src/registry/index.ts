/** Every registered source. **One domain = one source** (2026-07-09) — a source may hold
 *  several languages, and language is a per-document property decided at ingest, never
 *  inferred from the source. A sibling key exists only where the *domain* differs:
 *  `thelife-fr` is laviejenparle.com and `thelife-zh` is uwota.com, so they stay separate;
 *  cru.org's Spanish lives under `/mx/es/` and therefore belongs to `cru` itself.
 *
 *  One non-English variant was investigated but NOT registered: thelife's Persian site
 *  (shagerdan.com) serves a Cloudflare 403 wall to non-JS fetchers (FOLLOW-UP G / #8).
 *  That wall is now passable in principle — `everystudent` is the first registered
 *  source to declare `fetchStrategy: "firecrawl"` (ADR-0012) — but shagerdan.com stays
 *  unregistered until someone slices it and funds the credits.
 *
 *  EveryStudent spans three WALLED domains, all registered:
 *  everystudent.com → `everystudent`, everyarabstudent.com → `everystudent-ar` and
 *  questions2vie.com → `everystudent-fr` (slice #10, closing the #112 route). All
 *  three are Cloudflare-walled and fetched through Firecrawl.
 *
 *  It ALSO spans ~48 NON-walled sibling-language domains (#111), each its own key
 *  under the same one-domain-one-source rule. 32 are registered here — the
 *  2026-07-28 pilot batch (`-es` `-zh-cn` `-ru` `-ro` `-ja` `-pt` `-de` `-ko`),
 *  the 2026-07-29 batch 2 (`-sq` `-fa` `-mn` `-tr` `-cs` `-hu` `-pl` `-sr` `-et`
 *  `-vi` `-zh-tw` `-bg`) and batch 3 (`-sk` `-id` `-ms` `-mk` `-lt` `-bn` `-th`
 *  `-hr` `-am` `-it` `-ur` `-el`). Unlike the walled three these are plain HTTP —
 *  no `fetchStrategy`, no Firecrawl credits — and they use sitemap DISCOVERY, with
 *  `seedPaths` only to patch a stale sitemap.
 *
 *  **There is no shared template.** The ".content4 family" claim in the walled
 *  entries describes a MINORITY of the estate. Measured across 32 hosts with the
 *  repo's own parser (`extract.ts`, node-html-parser), containers are:
 *    - `.contentpadding` — `-es` `-ru` `-ro` `-pt` `-de` `-pl` `-hu` `-tr` `-vi`
 *      `-fa` `-sr` `-id` `-ms` `-mk` `-bn` `-th` `-hr` `-am`. On most of these
 *      `.content4` MATCHES and extracts 0 chars.
 *    - `html` — `-ko` `-sq` `-mn` `-lt`. Malformed FreeFind markup pops the
 *      element stack, destroying `.content4`, `.contentpadding` AND `<body>`;
 *      the article ends up as flat children of `<html>`. On `-ko` `-sq` `-mn` the
 *      culprit is a `<sitelevel_noindex>` closing inside `.contentpadding`; on
 *      `-lt` it is two articles with an unclosed `<span>` and a `</h1>` closing
 *      an `<h2>`.
 *    - `.content4` — `-ja` only.
 *    - `#content4` — `-el`, where `content4` is an ID, NOT a class. `.content4`
 *      matches nothing there. One character between working and silent zero.
 *    - `.cb-entry-content` — `-zh-cn`, WordPress (Chosen theme).
 *    - `.entry-content` — `-zh-tw`, WordPress (Enfold/Avia), and `-sk`,
 *      WordPress + Elementor. Same selector, two unrelated themes.
 *    - `.post-content` — `-it`, WordPress (`sight2016`). A THIRD WordPress theme
 *      with a THIRD container — one WP host never predicts another.
 *    - `.contentleftpadding` — `-et`, an older hand-rolled layout. None of the
 *      .content4-family selectors exist here at all.
 *    - `.content` — `-cs`, a bespoke Yii PHP app. #111's ".content .content-13"
 *      hint was one element's class attribute; `content-13` is the article id.
 *      NOTE `-sk` is NOT this app despite the sibling domain — it is WordPress,
 *      and `.content` matches 0 of its pages.
 *    - `.article-content` — `-bg`, an Angular build.
 *
 *  Also measured on this estate and easy to trip over:
 *    - `-el`'s sitemap publishes `http://` `<loc>`s. `discover.ts` filters the RAW
 *      `<loc>` string and never rewrites the scheme, so the `^https://` pin every
 *      sibling uses discovers ZERO URLs there. Its filters use `^https?://`.
 *    - `-sk`'s canonical host is the BARE apex (`www.` 301s away) — the reverse of
 *      every other sibling, where the apex 301s to `www.`.
 *
 *  Two traps this cost us. (1) `contentSelectors` is NOT a fallback chain —
 *  `extract.ts` binds the FIRST selector matching an ELEMENT even at 0 chars, so a
 *  zero-text match SHADOWS every working selector after it. Ship ONE measured
 *  selector. (2) Verify by extracted TEXT LENGTH, never by grepping for the class
 *  name — every FreeFind host declares .content4 in an inline <style> block, and
 *  on `-mn` the raw bytes contain `<div class="contentpadding">` that the parser
 *  never builds as an element.
 *
 *  Note `<body>` is absent from the parsed tree on MOST of these hosts, so
 *  extract.ts's `?? root` is the real fallback — it returns the whole document
 *  (including a literal "<!DOCTYPE html>" text node), not a tidy nav blob.
 *
 *  A note once recorded here — that cru.org's Spanish locale had no real Spanish content —
 *  over-generalised from a single path. Only `/mx/es/.../10-pasos-basicos/` serves
 *  untranslated English bodies; it is blocked in `cru`, while ~489 of the remaining
 *  `/mx/es/` pages are genuine Spanish (and ~39 are untranslated English that only a
 *  per-document body check can catch). See `cru.ts` and docs/sources.md. */
