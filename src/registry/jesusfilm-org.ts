/**
 * Jesus Film Project (jesusfilm.org) — slice #3's source and the first on the
 * discovery-crawl model (docs/architecture.md §3 fetch policy / FOLLOW-UP F).
 * OWNED content. WordPress (Yoast sitemaps, `jesusfilm-2023` block theme),
 * Cloudflare-fronted but serves 200 — no challenge wall (probed 2026-05-26).
 *
 * The retrieval corpus is the ~351 `/blog/` teaching articles (devotional /
 * evangelism / parables / Bible-verse studies). `sitemap_index.xml` also lists
 * a page-sitemap (mostly `/give/` donation pages + `/about`) and a single
 * `.kml` location file — those are filtered out so only blog articles land.
 * Content lives in `.entry-content` (the WP block-theme post wrapper); the
 * related-posts widget is stripped.
