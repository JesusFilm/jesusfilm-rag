/**
 * Sightline Ministry (sightlineministry.org) — slice #4. The first source to
 * REUSE slice #3's discovery-crawl machinery (docs/architecture.md §3 fetch
 * policy / FOLLOW-UP F) with no new acquisition code: same WordPress/Yoast shape
 * as jesusfilm.org (`sitemap_index.xml`, serves 200, empty `Disallow:`, no
 * challenge wall — probed 2026-05-27). PARTNER content. Distinctive value is the
 * apologetics / skeptic / evidence axis.
 *
 * The retrieval corpus is two teaching buckets, both rendered in
 * `.o-longform-content__content`: ~414 apologetics/teaching **posts** (bare-root
 * `/<slug>/`) and ~1,000 **daily devotionals** (`/daily-devo/<slug>/`). We seed
 * the two content sitemaps directly rather than `sitemap_index.xml`, because
 * posts live at bare-root — path-indistinguishable from `page`/`contact` entries —
 * so the index would also pull in the asset (470), post_tag (124), category,
 * author, event and job sitemaps. The `resource` sitemap (45) is excluded: those
 * are `.o-principle-block` card/hub pages, not longform prose.
