/**
 * Temporary rights quarantine for predominantly Bible-translation pages,
 * guarded in ONE place because it is ONE rule, not thirteen.
 *
 * A public source-page citation preserves provenance, but it does not identify
 * the Bible translation, rights holder, reuse terms, or attribution notice a
 * consumer may be required to display. The registry's source-level `rights`
 * field can also misattribute third-party translation text to the ministry that
 * hosts it. Until the corpus can represent those facts and return required
 * attribution, pages made predominantly of Bible-translation text stay out of
 * acquisition. Ordinary Scripture quotations inside ministry articles are
 * unaffected.
 *
 * This file guards the smaller instance found on 2026-08-06: the
 * "Who was Jesus?" page, ~20-26k chars of curated highlights from John that state
 * the formula in their own first paragraph — excerpts taken straight from the
 * Bible with **no commentary added**. Thirteen banners publish it.
 *
 * It lives apart from registry.test.ts because it is a cross-source policy, not a
 * fact about any single entry, and because thirteen scattered assertions in
 * thirteen files is exactly how a policy silently loses a member.
