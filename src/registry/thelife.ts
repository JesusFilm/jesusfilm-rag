/**
 * thelife (thelife.com) — slice #5. **Live successor to the decommissioned
 * powertochange.com**: every powertochange content URL 301-redirects to
 * thelife.com (or to issuesiface.com for the `/discover/` + `/itv/` "issues"
 * sub-axis); the old WP sitemap is a 2014-2017 relic. thelife.com is Cru
 * Canada's modern discipleship/life-issues corpus — Statamic-powered, empty
 * `Disallow:` robots, no challenge wall. Probed 2026-05-29.
 *
 * **First Statamic source for the discovery crawler** (slice #3 was Yoast,
 * slice #4 was the same shape). Sitemap is a single flat `/sitemap.xml` with
 * 7,834 `<loc>` entries — no `<sitemapindex>`, so no recursion needed.
 *
 * **Scope (operator-chosen 2026-05-29):** articles + devotionals.
 *
 * **The true URL structure** (re-derived from the live sitemap at sub-step 1c
 * after the initial recon miscounted; see slice notes): articles live at
 * **bare-root single-segment slugs** like `/5-steps-to-staying-sober` (628 of
 * them in the sitemap, including a handful of nav/utility slugs blocked
 * below). The `/articles/` namespace contains ONLY tag-index pages
 * (`/articles/tags/<tag>`) — 478 of those, NOT articles. Devotionals are
 * `/devotionals/<slug>` (3,929); `/devotionals/tags/<tag>` is another 1,086
 * tag indexes that fail the single-segment hint and drop. Net policy intent
 * after the blocks below: ~623 articles + 3,929 devotionals ≈ **4,552 docs**.
 *
 * Taking the broader scope (vs. articles-only ~623) is a deliberate fork
 * despite slice #4's small-source crowding signal (FOLLOW-UP I #15) — the goal
 * is to sharpen the #15 evidence with a 4× source.
 *
 * Content selector `.article-body` covers BOTH shapes — confirmed on probes:
 * `/10-spiritual-questions-and-their-answers` → `<section class="article-body
 * dropcap">` (article, ~12k words shell), `/devotionals/a-higher-calling` →
 * the same `.article-body` wrapper (devotional, ~1.4k words). `.spaces-content`
 * is a wider page shell; we keep it as a lower-priority fallback.
